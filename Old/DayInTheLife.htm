<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Your
alarm goes off and you roll out of bed hoping that all the warm water for your
shower has not been used up yet. The Sun has long since risen and you quickly
get ready for another busy day. So far no two days or nights have been the same
and as you walk to the gym for the morning session you look at your schedule to
see what today will hold. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
notice the session this morning will be about stars. The lecture will be given
by a past astronomy camper, Elizabeth Waterhouse, who is now an undergraduate
student at Harvard -- could that be me someday you wonder? She talks about
stars in a way that seems complicated, but you seem to understand every word.
You are a little tired by the end of the talk, but she ends by asking your
group to head up to the 60&quot; telescope to make some observations of the
Sun, our closest star. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You've
never seen the Sun through a telescope before -- teachers have always said,
don't look at the Sun, it can blind you...but Don has set up some really cool
ways to observe the sun safely. One of the graduate students has set up a
telescope through which you can actually look through the eyepiece of the
telescope at the sun through a hydrogen-alpha filter -- you see a bunch of dark
spots on the sun and some flary things coming off it on the surface. The
student explains what you are looking at and you make notes in your observing
log about what you have learned. You then move on to learn about polarization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are a bunch of different objects to play with, called polarizers. You find it
exciting to be able to actually try things out for yourself since in your
normal science classes you are not allowed to &quot;touch anything unless told
since you'll probably break it.&quot; You qualitatively access that if you take
two of these polarizers and turn them in relation to each other you can see
different amounts of light coming through. Another graduate student explains
the details of how the polarizer works.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
you had breakfast just a little while ago you head back to the Minnesota
building for lunch. Jeff, a high school teacher helping with astronomy camp,
has set up a demonstration on the moon for after lunch. He gives you a
styrofoam ball and places you and your friends in a circle around a really bright
light in the center. You notice that depending on how you are standing and
where the ball is in relation to the light the shadow on the ball changes. Jeff
explains how this represents the phases of the moon work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Jeff is finished Don gets everyone together outside and hands out &quot;the
planets&quot; and cards to go with them. You are going to be part of a scale
model of the solar system. You notice that the sun is a big yellow ball and
everything else in very small in comparison. You are given the planet Jupiter
-- not quite as big as you had always imagined. The Sun is put in place and you
begin to walk down the path, by the time you reach the place where Jupiter is
you can hardly see the Sun anymore -- this is a long ways away you ponder. By
the time you reach Pluto's spot, the Sun is long gone. You hike to a look-out
point from where you can see Mt. Graham, Mt. Hopkins, Mt. Bigelow and Kitt Peak
around you. So many telescopes in one area, now wonder Arizona is a huge place
for astronomy. Maybe I'll consider applying to the UA when I get ready to go to
college. At the lookout Don has airline tickets to the nearest stars --
Iceland, one of the closest stars on this scale -- such a long ways away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You return to the Minnesota building and are given a snack
before learning about Space Art from a well-known space artist, Kim Poor. I
never realized astronomy had so many applications. Dinner is soon to come, then
you all crowd into your vans to head to Mt. Bigelow for an evening of
observing. Tonight David Levy will speak -- how exciting to meet a famous
astronomer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>David talks about
the heavens, tells a little about his observing comets and his discoveries and
then he opens the dome of the telescope and trains it on a really interesting
planetary nebula. You record its name in your observing journal and look
through the eyepiece in awe. There are a bunch of activities you have available
for tonight, you can stay here and observe with the big scope or go learn about
CCD's, look for asteroids with the Schmidt telescope, learn about small
telescopes and how to find things in the sky with amateur astronomer Chris
Vedeler or even see what is going on with Don's research projects that a couple
undergraduates are working on with the NICMOS Camera of the Hubble Space
Telescope. Some other undergraduates from Arizona State University have a
station set up with projects on Mars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At 8:30 Don brings everyone outside to look for the bright
satellite pass of TRMM. He explains why we are able to see the pass -- how the
sun reflects off of the panels and causes the satellite to be illuminated. It
moves across the sky slowly, brightly to begin with and fading in time until
you can no long see it -- amazing. You get tired as the night goes on, but
there is so much to do, you move from one activity to another. Soon Jupiter is
rising above the trees and when you look through the big scope you can see
detail in the atmosphere of Jupiter and the four Galilean satellites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By now you have learned how to operate the 61&quot;
telescope, how to use a CCD camera, how to work with HST images and you are
beginning to understand how things move around in the sky. Saturn should be
visible with the telescope soon. Before you know it, the sun is close to coming
up again and it is time for you to go to sleep. It has been a long day, but so
much fun. Only a few more days of camp, maybe Mom and Dad will let me come to
the advanced camp next year...</p>
