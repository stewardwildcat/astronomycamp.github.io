<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
Shirley Brice Heath says above, there are valuable opportunities for learning
outside of schools and homes: openings that may encourage certain social and
academic skills and talents that neither schools nor family, the most
researched areas of education, may engender quite so well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Searching for learning opportunities that
foster intrinsic motivation in youth, that get adolescents fires lit
(Larson, 2000, p. 171), educational researchers like Heath and Larson have
begun to investigate successful educational programs outside of school and home
in order to discover what youth gain from these opportunities and how they can
help develop intrinsic motivation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Heaths ten-year study of community youth organizations for youth from
low socio-economic backgrounds forms a substantial part of the research on such
programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, most of the
organizations that she has studied focus on service, athletics, or the arts as
the driving forces of their organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Comparably little inquiry has been done regarding programs that are
successful in developing intrinsic motivation in carrying out science, history
or math, and this is the opening of research that I pursue in this paper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The majority of my
teaching and educational experience has taken place in informal settings, the
third element that Shirley Brice Heath (2001) discusses in her work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such an arena has always seemed to promote
opportunities for children and youth not available in school or at home,
including unique relationships with adults, longer-term activities and
projects, and an unusual sense of community with peers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So it was natural when setting out to choose
a masters project that I look for an educational situation outside of
school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This choice was further
stimulated by an introduction to the work of Shirley Brice Heath through some
of my research on the arts in education during my first semester of graduate
school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her studies of successful
community youth organizations, particularly those focused on the arts, and the
impact they have on youth intrigued me and aroused my curiosity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The task then became finding a successful
educational situation that seemed to light kids fires in which I might already
have or easily develop a connection, as this would allow me to delve deeper
into the program in the shorter amount of time allowed in the scope of a
masters project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
found such an opportunity surprisingly close to home in the Advanced Astronomy
Camp run through The University of Arizona Alumni Association.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is directed by Dr. Donald W. McCarthy,
Jr., a man with whom I have had a long and genuine relationship, who had in
fact inspired my interest in education: my father.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Although I initially questioned whether I should research a
program led by a close family member, the pieces began to fit together for
researching Camp.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Astronomy Camp has an excellent reputation
among campers and their parents extending over the fourteen years of its
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many youth who attend come back
to subsequent camps, stay in touch over the years, and speak of Camps impact
on their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Parents also stay in
touch, often writing emails and sending letters of thanks to Don for the influence
Camp has had on their children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One
parent wrote an email to Don after her son returned home after Advanced
Astronomy Camp this summer asking, why your camps are so life-altering.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This enthusiasm, lasting over the years, was
a key element that I was looking for in a successful out-of-school
educational program; it would allow for better relationships and the
development of trust with participants and parents that might also in turn
provide an opportunity for a longer-term study in the future.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The short duration of Camp lent itself to
the compass of my masters project: I could take part in the entire program
from beginning to end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition,
Astronomy Camp seemed analogous to the organizations Heath studied, which meant
a lead in comparative study in a somewhat under-researched area of
education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I also felt like I had
enough background experience in science and astronomy yet enough unfamiliarity
with Astronomy Camp itself to be both an insider and an outsider as a
researcher (Kondo, 1990).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I certainly
had a good connection and relationship with the Director and after some
conversation it appeared that he was as interested as I in what we might learn
from the research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was also apparent
that my participation as a researcher and a counselor might be a positive
contribution to Astronomy Camp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
conversation continued about the specifics of my research, it became apparent
that the Advanced Astronomy Camp (versus the Beginning Astronomy Camp) would be
more appropriate for two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>First, since my primary source of knowledge would be interviews with the
campers, older youth (high school versus middle school) would probably be more
articulate and willing to share their views, an important advantage as this was
a first research project not only for me, but for the Camp as well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Second, the attendance at Beginning
Astronomy Camp was fluctuating and very unsure, with cancellations up to the
first day, probably in part because of the September 11<sup>th</sup> tragedy
and parents unwillingness to send their children across the country to Tucson,
Arizona.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So in early June I flew to
Tucson, Arizona to help plan, prepare, and assist at the three summer Astronomy
Camps (Beginning, Advanced, and Educator) and to collect data for my masters
project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
purpose of this study is to understand what makes Advanced Astronomy Camp so
successful in the eyes of the youth and how the staff helps to create this
educational experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More
specifically, why do youth come to Advanced Astronomy Camp and how do they perceive
its influence on their lives?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How do
the Director and counselors perceive the campers experiences at Advanced
Astronomy Camp and how do they see themselves directing and influencing
particular aspects of Camp?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Narrowing
the focus even further, I designed interview questions for the campers (see
Appendix B) that followed three themes that I anticipated might be relevant to
their experiences: affective aspects (confidence, community, personal
interactions), science knowledge (science, math, critical thought), and ways of
being in the world (careers, higher education, what scientists do).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interview questions for the counselors and
the Director (Appendix B) followed affective aspects (building confidence,
supporting community), teaching (goals, techniques), and roles at Camp (fitting
into the big picture, being scientists and/or teachers).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Directors interview also included
questions concerning his goals for the counselors as well as the campers and
his perspective about the strengths and weaknesses of Advanced Astronomy
Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I analyzed the interviews for
campers and staff separately using a two-step coding process, looking for
themes as well as outlying responses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Advanced
Astronomy Camp is a limited program, reaching only thirty-three students during
eight days and nights in the summer of 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This small scope lends itself to researching what youth find valuable
about it in addition to how the staff help create (purposefully or not) such an
experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is a unique program, not
duplicable due to its location at the astronomical facilities on Mt. Lemmon in
Tucson, AZ, the important role of the Director (Don) in its design, and the
different combination of campers, counselors, weather conditions, and multiple
other variables that change from year to year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, it may provide insight into an unusual and highly reputed
science education program outside of school</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
this study I seek to understand why high school youth come to Advanced
Astronomy Camp and how they perceive its influence on themselves in addition to
how the staff helps to create this experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the literature review that follows, I attempt to provide a background
for my research on Camp by briefly investigating three different areas: science
camps and related educational experience, community youth organizations, and
scientific inquiry that seeks to more closely imitate what professional
scientists do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The section on
methodology includes a description of what Advanced Astronomy Camp is like in
addition to a detailed account of the methods I used in researching Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Analysis of the interviews with the campers
and staff reveals several themes in what they thought was valuable about
Advanced Astronomy Camp and the ensuing discussion probes the potential
relevance of these themes to comparable educational situations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Searching for
relevant literature that would enlighten the research on Advanced Astronomy
Camp was very difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Shirley
Brice Heath put it, The third arena of learning, that which takes place beyond
classroom and home, is generally left unattended, minimally supported, and
almost completely unexamined (Heath, 2001).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Indeed, not much has been written about the third arena, including
science camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Furthermore, Advanced
Astronomy Camp is an unusual situation in that it is unlike most science camps
and informal science education in general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Though Camp has elements in common with them, in many ways it has more similarities
to the dynamics of the community youth organizations described by Heath and
others; additionally it has a distinct philosophy of teaching science, one that
might be considered to come closer to the type of inquiry that professional
scientists do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So in order to shed
light onto this educational program and the experiences of the youth there,
this literature review has three primary components: comparative informal
science education (particularly science camps), research on community youth
organizations, and authentic scientific inquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Helping youth go
on in science is very important to society today, especially those considered
to be underrepresented in the field (i.e. girls, specific race and ethnic
groups, and those from lower socioeconomic classes).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>As Kay Andrews (2001) notes about extra educational programs in
the United Kingdom, Research suggests that involvement in science clubs
provides the little bit extra that can be the all-important difference
between going on with science or not (pp. 160-161).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Recognizing this, the National Science Teachers Association
issued a statement describing the ways in which informal science education,
whether in the form of camps, museums, field trips, multiple media (such as
videos and TV), or learning at home, is relevant and needed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Informal science education, they say, can
increase the time students engage in science, extend to the affective,
cognitive, and social realms, provide opportunities for students to form different
sorts of relationships with adults, allow for different learning styles and
multiple intelligences, afford the sharing of moments of intellectual
curiosity between care providers and children, give more direct access to
career role models in the sciences, and emphasize creativity and enrichment
(NSTA, 1998).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>However, although
informal science education is a field containing many programs of different
natures, it is still a relatively little researched area.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its diversity makes it difficult to draw out
common themes and differences in various programs and what makes them
successful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Within the field, museums
and science centers are by far the most studied (Dierking &amp; Martin, 1997).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is clear from the National Science
Foundations website dedicated to informal science education just how
frequently many museums and associated programs are studied as opposed to
longer-term educational programs outside of school.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Since this literature focuses to a large degree on the dynamics
of one-time visits to science exhibits or presentations, I did not find that it
contained much relevance for comparatively extended educational endeavors like
the Advanced Astronomy Camp, which lasted eight days and eight nights.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unfortunately the much smaller body of
literature on science camps, clubs, and other extended programs contains mostly
anecdotal and how-to accounts of how to start your own science program rather
than thorough descriptions, program evaluations, or other research on these
programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> or leadership dynamics
influence the program, and how they assess what children have gained from these
experiences is not described in detail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However there are a handful of descriptive articles that provide
pictures of what can happen at a science camp or related program and these
comprise the focus of the first section of this literature review.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The descriptions that follow give basic
descriptors about these science programs such as the targeted participants and
the programmatic content and length in addition to what is unique about each
experience and the research surrounding it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The GIRLS (gifted,
intelligent, real-life scientists) science camp is directed toward fifteen
fifth- and sixth-grade girls and the older high school girls that help mentor
and teach. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is free for those
accepted into the program though no application process is described except
that the students otherwise would not be able to afford a science camp
experience (Zanelli &amp; Smith, 2000, p. 46).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The students engage in exploratory, hands-on learning through
lessons designed by the participating science teachers and a select group of
female high school science scholars (p. 46) that mentor the girls and are in
turn mentored by the teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The camp
setting allows students more access to the great outdoors and related
activities than a typical school setting but generally the lessons appear to be
quite similar to what might occur in a middle school science class.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The week-long camp (whether residential or
day only is not specified) receives high ratings from participants as well as
parents who believed that their daughters participation  increased their
confidence in understanding science (p. 47).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This article, co-written by one of the science teachers, Zanelli, and
the high school student who worked with her, Smith, is an example of the type
of two-page article typically written about such science camp experiences.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What makes it unusual is the emphasis on
older girls mentoring younger campers and the first-person description by one
of the high school girls, recounting the meaningful and empowering nature of
the camp experience for herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>KIDS (kids
investigating and exploring science), an extended science education program run
by the University of California at Irvine, targets Latino children from lower
income families to provide an engaging and challenging university-based
science camp (Rodriguez, 1998, p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The children range in age from kindergarten through middle school and
learn about the program through the Santa Ana Unified School District.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rodriguez, a professor of Environmental
Studies and the founder of the program, characterizes it as an environmental
framework with enthusiastic parents, compassionate student assistants, and
gifted bilingual teachers (p. 9) with leaders who also include distinguished
minority faculty, serv[ing] as role models and mentors (p. 9).<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The camp emphasizes project-based learning
on topics at the forefront of biology where the students actually envision
themselves as young scientists working side-by-side with the multiple leaders
(p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rodriguez cites improved grades
in school as well as anecdotal comments from principals about students
subsequent leadership in science within their school classrooms as evidence of
the camps positive impact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although
the duration of this day camp and a more detailed description of what actually
occurs on a daily basis are not given, a sustained effort is made to support
students throughout the school year through tutoring and university faculty
visits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is one of the few camps I
found that follows up in some way on students subsequent performances in
school and whose leader is a professional research scientist.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>One example of a
formal program evaluation of a science camp is the CPEP Summer Science Camp for
upper middle school youth (Bruckerhoff &amp; Bruckerhoff, 1996).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The purpose of this five-week day camp is to
increase the number of African-American, Hispanic, Native American, women, and
other underrepresented minority students who pursue college study and careers
in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology (p. 6), seeking to
provide eighth and ninth graders with a hands-on approach to science and
mathematics in addition to language arts, study skills, and career counseling, all
in line with the Connecticut state standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The activities themselves include full lesson plans and homework
assignments, designed and taught by school teachers in line with state
standards, but with a purposeful element of informal relationships between
students and teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A few projects
take place throughout the duration of the camp, including the newspaper which
each student contributes to producing, an example of the emphasis on
collaboration of peers (p. 50).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Evaluations by the students showed a high approval rating but there was
no information on how they were affected after they left the camp nor was it
apparent that the content and format of the camp was ever questioned, only how
much students liked the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A science camp in
Taiwan for seventh graders gifted in math and science had a purposeful
research and curriculum design directed to finding whether students
conceptions of the nature of science (NOS) would change over the course of six
days (Liu &amp; Lederman, 2002).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Twenty-nine gifted students participated for six hours each day in
intensive science inquiry-based activities (p. 115) led by university science
educators, graduate students, and experienced teachers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interestingly enough, there were apparently
no significant changes in students understanding of the nature of
science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One explanation offered for
this was that apparently the participants did not have enough time to be
engaged in more reflective activities and in-depth discussions that have been
shown to help students construct more informed understanding of NOS (p.
121).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another possibility was that the
presence and regular intervention of the students middle school teacher in all
aspects of the camp may have impacted their willingness to engage in new types
of thinking and understanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unlike
the other literature described thus far, Liu and Lederman systematically
pursued a specific research question rather than engaging solely in a
descriptive account of the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They
also had a clear philosophy for the design of science teaching and
inquiry-related activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>An extended
informal science education program that is not a camp is the Young Scholars
Program at The Ohio State University, directed toward academically talented,
economically disadvantaged minority students with the primary goal of
increasing their agricultural literacy (Jones, 1997, p. 663).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This six-year program takes place during the
regular school year and primarily includes field trips, presentations, and
interactions with university faculty from the field of agriculture, culminating
in research groups in twelfth grade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Unlike previous years of the program, the design during the year
described by Jones was changed to be more informal and responsive to students
interests, exposing students to aspects of our field that we hoped would be
interesting, culturally pertinent, and as aesthetically pleasing as possible
(p. 664).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This attention to student
interest (leaders responded directly to students comments on what they would
like to learn) and especially to aesthetic elements is quite unusual in the
literature on informal science education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In addition, purposeful interactions between university students and
faculty who were all female and men of color (p. 663) were emphasized so that
students could have positive role models that broke the image of agriculture
being a white male discipline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Evaluations were done through student essays reflecting on their
experiences, another unusual element, designed to be less intrusive than the
familiar questionnaire or typical evaluation form.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Unlike Liu and Lederman, Jones found that the relaxation of the
content of this educational experience seemed to allow students to interpret
the demonstrations in ways that were more meaningful (p. 676), demonstrating
that the changes made in the program were successful.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The only
description of a well-documented residential camp that I could find was of the
Fairbanks American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) Science Camp,
a camp designed to promote relationships between Alaskan Native American elders
and high school students interested in science (Bradley &amp; Reyes,
2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This article carefully related
the philosophy of the Director and camp activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Unlike almost all the other camps described here, student
activities consisted of self-chosen research projects required to be
scientifically sound and to incorporate elders knowledge (p. 44).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Another unusual characteristic was the
requirement of a significant application in order to attend, including the
students academic record, teacher recommendation, and written essay.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Significant resources, primarily in the form
of computers and teachers, were provided for the students research so that
beyond their own observations or experiments and discussions with the elders,
they could perform comparative research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The primary goals of the camp were to perform solid science and connect
with students native cultures, addressing both the students academic and
developmental needs (p. 42).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Indeed, the
feedback from students and elders in the form of interviews confirms that
cultural connections were made and valued by both generations, and success of
student science projects at local and state science fairs demonstrates the
quality of some of the projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
many respects this camp comes closest to the Advanced Astronomy Camp in that
students send in a serious application for the camp, stay for both nights and
days, and research self-chosen projects with the assistance of the adults
present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
even this smattering of six science camps and related educational programs, it
becomes evident how different the programs are and how sparse the literature of
this field is in demonstrating what can be successful about short-term informal
science education. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The participants
range in age from fifth to twelfth grade, varying in the degree to which
different age groups interact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Only one
camp mentioned any social dynamics between students and then only in the
context of the older students formally mentoring the younger (Zanelli &amp;
Smith, 2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The content varies from
pre-chosen teacher-directed experiments to field trips responsive to student
input to completely student-chosen research projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Seemingly the programs provide opportunities to further science learning
in school but the activities and who chose them were remarkably similar to
school when descriptions were given except in the case of the Fairbanks AISES
Science Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The time allotted for the
programs ranged from 1-5 weeks to select days over the course of the school
year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The article describing the only
residential camp, the Fairbanks AISES Science Camp, did not clarify whether
this aspect of the camp was intentional or integral to the philosophy of the camp
nor what impact it may have had on students, teachers, and elders.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>However, there
were some commonalities among the camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In almost all of the descriptions, there was an emphasis on informal
relationships between students and teachers and on cooperative relationships
among students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a few cases there
was also an interest in drawing students into university settings (Rodriguez,
1998; Jones, 1997; Liu &amp; Lederman, 2002) or at least into contact with
university science faculty in order to provide better role models.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the exception of the camp for gifted
seventh-grade students (Liu &amp; Lederman, 2002), all the other educational
programs were directed toward populations that might not otherwise have access
to science outside the classroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
would be difficult from these descriptions to say what elements might make for
better informal science programs or how one might decide what to include in the
design of a new camp, except for Jones (1997) evaluation that giving students
choice as to the program content was positive and Bradley and Reyes (2000)
conclusions that students benefited from interactions with Native Alaskan
elders in their science research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
might be informative to know what students perceived that they gained from the
programs, how their knowledge and understanding of science grew, what drew them
to the programs in the first place, and how interactions between peers and
leaders affected their experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As
a high school student, Kelly Smith could clearly articulate what she found
positive about her experiences teaching chemistry to younger girls (Zanelli
&amp; Smith, 2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why not discover
the perspectives of more students on what they find interesting or positive
about informal science situations?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Clearly
there are gaps in the literature on longer-term informal science education
programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Valerie Crane (1994) asserts
that informal science learning research has focused on the stimulus rather than
the learner, paid little attention to the context in which learning takes place,
ignored the complex interactions of informal learning, and overlooked the
influence of social mediators on learning (p. 186), but these learning dynamics
have begun to be researched in other areas, namely community youth
organizations and adventure camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Studies of
community youth organizations, while not necessarily dealing with science, have
much in common with the general situation of a residential camp in that they
examine some of the dynamics that make certain organizations more successful
than others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Noting that the primarily
studied aspects of learning in childrens lives are the duo of school and
family, Shirley Brice Heath, R.W. Larson, and several others have begun to
look more closely at what they term a third element, the arena outside of
school and home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Larsons (2000)
interest in this arena began as he searched for situations that helped to
develop intrinsic motivation in adolescents, which he defines as having two
components: wanting to be doing an activity and being invested in it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He found that while such dual interest and
high concentration was lacking in schoolwork and unstructured leisure time, it
was very present in structured voluntary activities, such as sports, arts, and
participation in organizations, in which youth experience the rare combination
of intrinsic motivation in combination with deep attention (p. 170).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Studies on adventure camps are also relevant
to this field because of shared social dynamics and activities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hattie, Marsh, Neill, and Richards (1997)
found that the overall effects from participating in an adventure program not
only lasted but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>increased </i>over time;
something which should draw the attention of any educator.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While small in breadth and primarily
stemming from the work of Shirley Brice Heath and her associates, the research
of the past decade concerning not-often-looked-to community youth organizations
and adventure camps has found commonalities amongst some that suggest what
makes some programs more successful than others: their voluntary nature,
youth-centeredness, a temporal arc of activity with real-world constraints,
informal cross-age relationships, and opportunities for youth to play multiple
roles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Community youth
organizations are organized around their being voluntary: youth choose to come
and select in which activities to participate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>While some might certainly come because of their parents admonitions,
leaders involved in the organizations assert that it is students choices that
bring them and keep them engaged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looking at after-school study support programs in the United Kingdom,
MacBeth, Kirwan, and Myers (2001) found:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Choosing whether
or not to participate and what to participate in opens access to a range of
benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Having the option to choose
from a number of different pleasurable learning activities is itself empowering
and likely to increase self-esteem, even if simply by virtue of being trusted
to make choices. (p. 50)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Bently and Gurumurthy (1999)
reached similar conclusions about the importance of activities reaching youth
in the United Kingdom being voluntary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Another reason why voluntarism is essential is because effective youth
organizations situate their curricula within the youth and not within external
rules or mandates (Heath &amp; McLaughlin, 1994, p. 484).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because the organizations are voluntary,
they must tailor their activities to youths interests although they are not
unstructured or without restraints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This can lead to a sense of greater autonomy for the youth, as their
interests are sought after and met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
educational programs for adolescents are youth-centered, young people learn
quickly in these groups that they are needed resources and not problems in need
of fixing (Heath &amp; McLaughlin, 1994, p.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

input into the choice of activities and consequent participation in them is
seen as essential to the success of the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

positive consequences like changes in youths language use as Heath (1999) documented:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>When an

young learners become embedded in ever widening frames for building future
scenarios  Language development follows from activity and roles that
legitimate membership and the overarching purpose of the group. (p. 72)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Some of the language changes Heath
(1999) found were the use of conditionals (if-then statements), modals (could,
should, and would), strategies to get clarification from others, and varied
genres and voices (youth playing multiple roles and giving multiple
perspectives).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She points these out as
important attributes of the type of problem-solving talk essential to
contemporary work places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Similarly,
MacBeth et al. (2001) discovered that students taking a more active role in
shaping and evaluating the study support programs increased their
identification with, and ownership of, study support (p. 68).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Centering educational programs on youth also
leads to more challenging activities, another key element in successful
programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Heath
(2001) describes common dynamics that community youth organizations share with
scientific research laboratories: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Work takes place
within a temporal arc, with phases that move from planning and preparation
for the task ahead, to practice and deliberation along with ample
trial-and-error learning, to final intensive readiness for production or
performance; and, ultimately, to a culminating presentation of the work that
has gone before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Evaluation by
outsiders, peers, and professional critics follows along with some down time
before the next cycle of work begins. (p. 13)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>In a school classroom there is
often little time for such extensive projects where students participate from
beginning to end and have the added challenge of receiving feedback from
professional outsiders, augmenting the risk involved in the activity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In their meta-analysis of adventure programs
in Australia and North America, Hattie et al. (1997) also found that one significant
aspect of adventure camps is the planned transfer of experience and decisions
encountered during the earlier parts of the course to critical decisions later
in the program (p. 57), so that participants experienced the consequences of
decisions made early at the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their
analysis also pointed to the challenging, yet reachable goals that were set for
participants, similar to longer-term risky endeavors that teens face in
youth-centered community organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Further, they point out that feedback is the most powerful single
moderator that improves affective and achievement outcomes (p. 58), finding in
their meta-analysis of over 300 adventure programs, that the most powerful
effect was related to feedback (p. 58).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This element of
feedback by leaders, outside experts and peers helps provide real-world
constraints to youth activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Similarly, in many youth organizations the continuation of the program
relies on the youths abilities to draw in funding or audiences for their
exhibits or plays; the decisions they make determine the future of the
organization just as they would in real-life workplaces.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So the feedback serves a very real need,
both in the process of working through a project, and in the success of final
presentations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another strength
of community youth organizations and arguably some informal science programs is
the opportunity for informal relationships between adults and students and
between different ages of students to form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>MacBeth et al. (2001) assert that such informality eased the ability of
adults to offer both praise and criticism without the social sanction that is
often associated with being singled out in school (p. 63).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Heath (1999) points out that times when youth
and adults work together are rapidly decreasing along with the inherent
language development that used to occur in such contexts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She found that in community organizations
where adults and youth worked together on a common task:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>[Adults help]
enable youth to be self-conscious in their use of language, reflective and
self-critical about what their discourse does and does not accomplish, and
gradually comfortable and habituated in their language forms.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather than learned helplessness in
language, the youth take on a learned helpfulness approach to oral and written
language and to the type of information, argumentation, and presentation that
accomplish work. (p. 71)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Also significant are the
opportunities for youth of different ages to work with each other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cross-age communities of practice enhance
everyones role, since everyone has an opportunity to be both apprentice and
expert, teacher and learner (Heath &amp; McLaughlin, 1994, p. 485).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is similar to real work places such as
science laboratories where members range in age and experience, and novices
work along with older more experienced scientists and artists, and often with
experts who have outside professional identities (Heath, 2001, p. 13).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In community youth organizations where
students participate for several consecutive years, there are many
opportunities for youth to learn from each other, whether formally designated
as teachers, or simply passing on experiences from one to another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Within
this community youth assume real roles in the planning, organization, and
management of the program, and usually move to fill more than just one role,
whether it is calling for travel arrangements, leading a dance class for
younger students, providing constructive criticism to a peer on a piece of art,
or brainstorming ideas with the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Filling these sorts of roles is crucial to equip youth for future
opportunities in other workplaces, in developing the sorts of language
abilities discussed earlier (Heath, 1999), and in making educational programs
intrinsically youth-centered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Speaking
specifically to the uniqueness that arts-based organizations provide, Heath and
Roach (1999) articulate the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Young people in
arts-based organizations gain practice in thinking and talking as adults.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They play important roles in their organizations;
they have control over centering themselves and working for group excellence in
achievement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their joint work with
adults and peers rides on conversations that test and develop ideas, explicate
processes, and build scenarios of the future. (p. 26)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The categorization of the
characteristics important to successful youth organizations described above is
artificial but hopefully useful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is
interesting to note some of the differences between these organizations and the
informal science programs described earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>While they both stress informal relationships between youth and adults,
there is a stronger emphasis on collaboration of peers, choice, and high
involvement of youth in leading and contributing to activities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also fascinating is the comparison Heath
(2001) draws between the youth organizations and professional science
laboratories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the collaboration,
talk, work, and inquiry found in science labs is desirable, what positive
outcomes might similar scientific communities for youth provide?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Might science camps incorporate the temporal
arcs of activity, aesthetics, constraints, and sense of community found in
community youth organizations and professional work places?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So far in this
paper I have reviewed recent literature available on science camps and
presented some of the dynamics of successful community youth organizations in
order to provide a framework of comparison for research on Advanced Astronomy
Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet while these programs give a backdrop
of comparable education situations they do not supply much in the way of
thinking about the scientific content of the Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Since one of the primary agendas of Advanced Astronomy Camp is to
facilitate youth-designed astronomy research projects, delving into recent
literature concerned with the scientific inquiry in schools is relevant to the
scope of this review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, it is
not within the differences between the thought and activities of professional
scientists to current science curricula in schools.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">   </span>It is common knowledge that the practices of professional
scientists are different than the experiences of youth in science classes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How are these experiences different?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How important is it that youth understand or
experience the thought processes of professional scientists?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Many researchers
are attempting to design and research science curricula that come closer to how
professional scientists think about and perform research.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The way science is taught in most schools
doesnt help students understand what scientists do and how they think (James
Stewart as quoted in Black, 2002, p. 4).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>One group of science education researchers attempting to do this is
Stewart, Cartier, and Rudolph (2001), who have been part of a large project
through the National Center for Improving Student Learning and Achievement in
Mathematics and Science (NCISLA) to use scientific modeling to help students
develop the type of complex and tentative thinking that professionals use.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They found that when models have been a
focus of classroom attention, students have learned that they are tentative constructions
that explain the natural world and that their usefulness is dependent upon the
kinds of questions they enable scientists to ask and answer (p. 7).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This type of instruction differs from simple
hands-on curricula because of the critical thinking students must develop in
order to explain and predict their data and be consistent with other relevant
models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When this type of thought
happens, Lehrer and Schauble have found increased student interest, ownership
of their work, and deeper understanding of content (as quoted in Foster, 1998,
p. 3), characteristics not unlike those found in successful community youth
organizations researched by Heath and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Assuming that
thinking like professional scientists is a positive goal, Chinn and Malhotra
(2002) analyzed the complexity of thought that professional scientists use to
do their research in contrast to that encouraged by both textbook-driven
inquiry and curricula developed by science education researchers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Analyzing simple inquiry projects in textbooks,
including experiments, observations and illustrations, in comparison to
specific research projects of various scientists, they found that the textbook
inquiry projects differed in the ways they approached generating research
questions, designing studies, making observations, explaining results,
developing theories, and studying research reports (pp. 183-186).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More specifically, some of the complex
scientific reasoning not often a part of school science tasks included: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>They concluded that simple inquiry
tasks may not only fail to help students learn to reason scientifically, they
may also foster a nonscientific epistemology in which scientific reasoning is
viewed as simple, certain, algorithmic, and focused at a surface level of
observation (p. 190).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In addition, Chinn
and Malhotra (2002) also found differences between research-driven curricula
and what they termed authentic scientific inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In their comparisons most research-developed tasks, while
building greater depth and self-generated thought in students than the
textbooks, do not attain all of the complexity of thought found in their
analyses of professional scientists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For instance, one significant aspect of being a scientist is generating
your own research question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While none
of the selected textbook tasks included this, only 12% of the 24
researcher-generated activities studied did so.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In only 2% of the textbook activities and 50% of the
researcher-developed tasks did students choose their own variables to
investigate and only activities included this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Some other areas of significant difference between research-generated
scientific inquiry and professional scientific inquiry included consideration
of methodological flaws, developing relatively complex controls, making
multiple observations, using analog models, and studying expert research
reports (pp.201-203).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, each
characteristic of authentic scientific inquiry that Chinn and Malhotra
identified was met by one of more of the twenty-six research-developed tasks
they studied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chinn and Malhotra
(2002) conclude that much work remains to be done to transform schools into
places that nurture epistemologically authentic science inquiry and call for
the creation of curricula that will support and develop that complexity of
thought (p. 214).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their study can serve
as a starting point for comparison and evaluation of whether students are
really being taught to think like scientists when this goal is considered
desirable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While many efforts are being
made to nurture this complexity of thought in schools, there remain
opportunities outside of school that might be used to further the development
of scientific thought in children and youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the literature on science camps above,
many current programs primarily consist of the same simple inquiry tasks done
in schools that educational researchers are trying to move away from.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In his theory of alchemy, Thomas Popkewitz
(1998, 2002) has noted the way academic disciplines as done by professionals in
universities or workplaces become transformed into very different, often
simplistic school subjects that are seen as more palatable for children and
youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whereas disciplines involve
competing sets of ideas about research  school subjects tend to treat
knowledge as uncontested and unambiguous content for children to learn or solve
problems with (1998, p. 27).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Popkewitz
asserts that this alchemy of disciplines can promote a limiting psychologizing
and managing of students souls in school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If the inquiry tasks generally encouraged in schools both teach a
simplistic epistemology to students and limit them in the ways Popkewitz
discusses, is it any accident that one of the strengths of community youth
organizations is that they encourage youth to take full responsibilities in
carrying out activities of importance to the local community with real limits
and constraints?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How can we make more
of these equipping and mentally challenging opportunities available in areas
outside of arts, sports, and service, the primary makeup of youth
organizations?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Granted, the alchemy
of disciplines is inevitable in classrooms and informal educational programs,
but what would be the effects of developing activities that include the type of
reasoning that Chinn and Malhotra (2002) identified as part of scientific
thinking? <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></p>

many educators see the importance of developing such scientific reasoning in
students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet how this is to be done is
still a question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Significant in Chinn
and Malhotras research (2002) is their conclusion that research-driven
inquiry, while a definite improvement on standard textbook tasks, does not go
far enough in schools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And even these
curricula are probably far less common in instructional activities than the
simple inquiry tasks propounded in standard science textbooks.<span

above did not come near to the type of curricula that science education
researchers are designing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Could not a
third arena provide an additional opportunity for pursuing more complex
science inquiry?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Might more time or
access to professional equipment and technology provide the opportunity for
students to generate their own questions, design their own experiments, choose
multiple variables, deal with methodological flaws in design and equipment,
develop theories for what happens and why, and make sense of comparisons with
other relevant research?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Might this not
only better equip students academically but also empower them in the way Lehrer
and Schauble (as quoted in Foster, 1998) described?<span style="mso-spacerun:

tests instructional approaches for fostering the development of such complex
strategies (p. 213).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Researching the
Advanced Astronomy Camp is just such an opportunity as the campers create
research questions, develop proposals, and with help from the professional and
student scientists at their disposal flesh out theories for how their data
makes sense with what the rest of the scientific world is saying.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This is not the
only reason for studying Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:

claim to be beneficial for students affective and academic development.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Heath (2001) also calls for more research in
the third arena:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Processes of
community youth organizations need studies that will detail how the people who
participate learn, what they acquire by way of skills and knowledge (p.
15).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My research of Advanced Astronomy
Camp has the potential to be just such an opportunity, adding a unique
viewpoint by interviewing the youth directly about what they feel they learned
and found valuable in the Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Larson
(2000) too appeals for research on the processes of learning that occurs in
structured youth activities and is also interested in how leaders of such
programs can best facilitate the development of youth: Leaders face the
fundamental problematic of allowing participants actions to be self-directed,
voluntary, and intrinsically motivated, yet also structured and challenging
enough that participants are stretched into new domains of complexity (p. 16).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Interviewing the Director and
counselors of Advanced Astronomy Camp may help to answer this question, at
least as it pertains to this particular program that is purported to be very
positive by the youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Camp is
potentially closer to professional astronomy in its access to scientists,
telescopes and related technology, and student-designed research than many
school opportunities and science camps allow and therefore poses a chance to
begin to pursue the questions Chinn and Malhotra (2002) raise.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This research on Advanced Astronomy Camp has
the potential to fill in one more gap in the research on informal science
education, third arena programs for youth, and scientific inquiry.</p>

activity of the day is brunch at noon with counselors preparing the food (with

afternoon includes different groups stories from the previous nights
observing, a daily Fermi problem (an estimation problem such as at any given
time how many flat tires are there in the United States?), one or more
lectures delivered by Don or a counselor (Spectroscopy &amp; Light, Lives &amp;
Deaths of Stars, The ~Ologies of Mars), and time to work on projects or debates
with team members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Dinner is usually
around 6pm (or whenever the pizzas are fully cooked given the high altitude)
followed by watching the sunset and competing to see who can find Venus,
Jupiter and the stars first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then it is
To the observatories! (a favorite quote from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

imaging and a sophisticated computer program for finding objects.<span

</span>This explains why the distribution of age is not equal (6 older and 4
younger campers).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, I did
not try to group the youth according to combinations of age, gender, or
experience due to the complexity of that process, so there are no young males
or females who had not attended Camp previously in the subjects of this
study.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Actually, this is reflective of
the thirty-three campers: there were no women going into their first two years
of high school who had not attended Camp before and only a few of the young men
were new to Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It may be that prior
experience at Beginning Astronomy Camp influences youth, especially women, to
attend Advanced Camp at a younger age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Except for the
Director and myself, I initially randomly selected half of the six staff to
interview.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However two more counselors
were added to the staff during the week before Camp, so I chose to select one
additional counselor in order to include half of the staff in the study.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Conveniently, the originally selected
counselors and the Director were evenly distributed among four of the five
telescope stations at Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since only
one telescope station was not represented in my original random selection, I
chose the counselor situated at the final site as my final staff interview.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Originally
conceived as a small-scale program evaluation, my study draws on two primary
theoretical sources that inform the data collection: illuminative evaluation as
envisioned by Parlett and Hamilton (1972) and constructivist grounded theory
(Charmaz, 2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because of the limits
and scope of the study I did not aim to completely understand and evaluate
every aspect of Advanced Astronomy Camp as an educational program but rather
chose to focus on the perceptions of the campers and staff, believing that
their opinions and experiences could enlighten why Camp has a reputation for
success with the youth who attend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Although I had a few ideas of what might make Camp successful,
semi-structured interviews were designed to let the participants give their own
perspectives and tell their own stories about Advanced Astronomy Camp, giving
voice to [the] respondents (Charmaz, 2000, p. 510).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Drawing on the idea of simultaneous collection and analysis of
data (Charmaz, 2000) from grounded theory, I eventually added two questions to
the camper interviews with based on themes that I perceived were arising.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The two questions I added concerned campers
thoughts and evaluations of the Mars Sample Return Debates and their
interactions with staff members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
first three campers I interviewed spoke to these themes without my questioning
them directly, and they had such strong opinions on them that I made sure that
I asked every subsequent camper about them, so all campers spoke to the additional
questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Though interviews
served as my primary data for analysis, I also collected data by serving as a
counselor and taking field notes at Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Reminded by Parlett and Hamilton (1972) that
the researcher is concerned to familiarize himself thoroughly with the
day-to-day reality of the setting or setting he is studying (p. 18) and that
it is important to situate qualitative research in historical and cultural
context (Charmaz, 2000), I sought to immerse myself in the world of Astronomy
Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To this purpose I also assisted
as a counselor at the Beginning and Educator Astronomy Camps, which preceded
and followed the Advanced Astronomy Camp in June 2002.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This heavy involvement allowed me to develop
a level of trust and relationship with the campers and counselors I interviewed
as I served alongside them cooking, cleaning, teaching, and helping with
observing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This also afforded me many
additional opportunities for conversation with all of the participants and a
sense of common language, openness, and co-constructing of meaning during the
interviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span

semi-structured interviews with the campers were tape-recorded over several
days both in person and by phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Campers were informed of their random selection for interviewing on the
fifth day of Camp and given the list of interview questions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the Camp was packed with activities, I
interviewed as many of the selected campers as possible during the last three
days of Camp at times that best fit their needs and desires.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interviews were conversational as I followed
the interview questions, pursued answers for better description, and clarified
questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As mentioned above, after
the first few interviews I noted a couple of themes arising in camper remarks
and added them in as questions: relationships with the staff and reactions to
the Mars Sample Return Debates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All but
two interviews were conducted in person; these took place over the phone within
two days of Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
five semi-structured interviews with the counselors and the Director were
recorded in person at their convenience over the month following Advanced

the questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each counselor had
access to the questions before his or her interview, which lasted 30 to 65
minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
the interviews were complete, I transcribed them and mailed the transcriptions

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Influenced
by grounded theory, I used a two-step open coding process (Charmaz, 2000) to
analyze the interviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After
transcribing the interviews I had a few ideas of what the some of the
categories ensuing from them might be, so I coded the interviews of the campers
and staff separately under those initial categories.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The categories for campers were the importance of peer
relationships, a sense of responsibility and empowerment with equipment and
with choice, a changing understanding of science, and positive informal
relationships with staff. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The initial
categories for staff were teaching science that mirrored professional science,
developing campers confidence, filling a niche at Camp, being scientists, and
demonstrating a general awareness of what campers took away from Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the process of coding both camper and
staff interviews, the categories grew more defined as sub-categories arose
within them and outlying responses began to become clear.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After outlining these new sub-themes I went
back to the transcripts for a second coding to see how these held with the
interviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While the interview
questions were originally directed toward several ideas I had about what
campers and staff might find valuable about Camp, the themes growing from the
conversations did not necessarily stem from particular questions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For instance, campers shared about the
importance of their peers at Camp in answer to questions about what they took
away from Camp, what the best aspects of Camp were, and what they learned about
science as well as direct questions about their peers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore instead of showing themes of
answers to specific interview questions, the analysis proceeds from one theme
to another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
analyzing the interviews, I counted how many campers or staff members spoke to
each theme and sub-theme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of the
campers and staff interviewed said something related to each over-arching
theme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In discussing the sub-themes and
outlying responses I use all when every camper or counselor spoke to an
issue, most for 80-90%, several for 40-70%, and a few for 30%.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hopefully this will clarify the analysis.</p>

kind of interest in astronomy, there were several different answers to this
question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Two students, Pam and Stacy,
said they were very interested and good in science at school, and their
teachers recommended Camp to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Brian

from the internet and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sky &amp; Telescope</i>.<span

either through a booklet of activities for gifted and talented students or
through <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Astronomy</i> magazine.<span

internet looking for a summer camp that would allow them to do astronomy; James
because he wanted to find peers he could talk with about science and Kris
because she desired something less expensive than Space Camp but just as
interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The students who had been
to an Astronomy Camp before each wanted to further their experiences and
continue learning; the appeal of Advanced Camp was increased time on the telescopes
and the lure of interesting projects.</p>

counselors why they came to Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:

give back something to the youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One
counselor experienced Advanced Camp as a camper years previously and wanted to
see another side of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another found
the experience lots of fun and the opportunity to do something meaningful for
teens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One said it was a way to give
back to the community and another just loved sharing astronomy. <span
