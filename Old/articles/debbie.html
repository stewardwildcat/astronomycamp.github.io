<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
Shirley Brice Heath says above, there are valuable opportunities for learning
outside of schools and homes: openings that may encourage certain social and
academic skills and talents that neither schools nor family, the most
researched areas of education, may engender quite so well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Searching for learning opportunities that
foster intrinsic motivation in youth, that get adolescents fires lit
(Larson, 2000, p. 171), educational researchers like Heath and Larson have
begun to investigate successful educational programs outside of school and home
in order to discover what youth gain from these opportunities and how they can
help develop intrinsic motivation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Heaths ten-year study of community youth organizations for youth from
low socio-economic backgrounds forms a substantial part of the research on such
programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, most of the
organizations that she has studied focus on service, athletics, or the arts as
the driving forces of their organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Comparably little inquiry has been done regarding programs that are
successful in developing intrinsic motivation in carrying out science, history
or math, and this is the opening of research that I pursue in this paper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The majority of my
teaching and educational experience has taken place in informal settings, the
third element that Shirley Brice Heath (2001) discusses in her work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such an arena has always seemed to promote
opportunities for children and youth not available in school or at home,
including unique relationships with adults, longer-term activities and
projects, and an unusual sense of community with peers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So it was natural when setting out to choose
a masters project that I look for an educational situation outside of
school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This choice was further
stimulated by an introduction to the work of Shirley Brice Heath through some
of my research on the arts in education during my first semester of graduate
school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her studies of successful
community youth organizations, particularly those focused on the arts, and the
impact they have on youth intrigued me and aroused my curiosity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The task then became finding a successful
educational situation that seemed to light kids fires in which I might already
have or easily develop a connection, as this would allow me to delve deeper
into the program in the shorter amount of time allowed in the scope of a
masters project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
found such an opportunity surprisingly close to home in the Advanced Astronomy
Camp run through The University of Arizona Alumni Association.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is directed by Dr. Donald W. McCarthy,
Jr., a man with whom I have had a long and genuine relationship, who had in
fact inspired my interest in education: my father.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Although I initially questioned whether I should research a
program led by a close family member, the pieces began to fit together for
researching Camp.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Astronomy Camp has an excellent reputation
among campers and their parents extending over the fourteen years of its
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many youth who attend come back
to subsequent camps, stay in touch over the years, and speak of Camps impact
on their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Parents also stay in
touch, often writing emails and sending letters of thanks to Don for the influence
Camp has had on their children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One
parent wrote an email to Don after her son returned home after Advanced
Astronomy Camp this summer asking, why your camps are so life-altering.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This enthusiasm, lasting over the years, was
a key element that I was looking for in a successful out-of-school
educational program; it would allow for better relationships and the
development of trust with participants and parents that might also in turn
provide an opportunity for a longer-term study in the future.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The short duration of Camp lent itself to
the compass of my masters project: I could take part in the entire program
from beginning to end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition,
Astronomy Camp seemed analogous to the organizations Heath studied, which meant
a lead in comparative study in a somewhat under-researched area of
education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I also felt like I had
enough background experience in science and astronomy yet enough unfamiliarity
with Astronomy Camp itself to be both an insider and an outsider as a
researcher (Kondo, 1990).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I certainly
had a good connection and relationship with the Director and after some
conversation it appeared that he was as interested as I in what we might learn
from the research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was also apparent
that my participation as a researcher and a counselor might be a positive
contribution to Astronomy Camp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
conversation continued about the specifics of my research, it became apparent
that the Advanced Astronomy Camp (versus the Beginning Astronomy Camp) would be
more appropriate for two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>First, since my primary source of knowledge would be interviews with the
campers, older youth (high school versus middle school) would probably be more
articulate and willing to share their views, an important advantage as this was
a first research project not only for me, but for the Camp as well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Second, the attendance at Beginning
Astronomy Camp was fluctuating and very unsure, with cancellations up to the
first day, probably in part because of the September 11<sup>th</sup> tragedy
and parents unwillingness to send their children across the country to Tucson,
Arizona.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So in early June I flew to
Tucson, Arizona to help plan, prepare, and assist at the three summer Astronomy
Camps (Beginning, Advanced, and Educator) and to collect data for my masters
project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
purpose of this study is to understand what makes Advanced Astronomy Camp so
successful in the eyes of the youth and how the staff helps to create this
educational experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More
specifically, why do youth come to Advanced Astronomy Camp and how do they perceive
its influence on their lives?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How do
the Director and counselors perceive the campers experiences at Advanced
Astronomy Camp and how do they see themselves directing and influencing
particular aspects of Camp?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Narrowing
the focus even further, I designed interview questions for the campers (see
Appendix B) that followed three themes that I anticipated might be relevant to
their experiences: affective aspects (confidence, community, personal
interactions), science knowledge (science, math, critical thought), and ways of
being in the world (careers, higher education, what scientists do).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interview questions for the counselors and
the Director (Appendix B) followed affective aspects (building confidence,
supporting community), teaching (goals, techniques), and roles at Camp (fitting
into the big picture, being scientists and/or teachers).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Directors interview also included
questions concerning his goals for the counselors as well as the campers and
his perspective about the strengths and weaknesses of Advanced Astronomy
Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I analyzed the interviews for
campers and staff separately using a two-step coding process, looking for
themes as well as outlying responses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Advanced
Astronomy Camp is a limited program, reaching only thirty-three students during
eight days and nights in the summer of 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This small scope lends itself to researching what youth find valuable
about it in addition to how the staff help create (purposefully or not) such an
experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is a unique program, not
duplicable due to its location at the astronomical facilities on Mt. Lemmon in
Tucson, AZ, the important role of the Director (Don) in its design, and the
different combination of campers, counselors, weather conditions, and multiple
other variables that change from year to year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, it may provide insight into an unusual and highly reputed
science education program outside of school</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
this study I seek to understand why high school youth come to Advanced
Astronomy Camp and how they perceive its influence on themselves in addition to
how the staff helps to create this experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the literature review that follows, I attempt to provide a background
for my research on Camp by briefly investigating three different areas: science
camps and related educational experience, community youth organizations, and
scientific inquiry that seeks to more closely imitate what professional
scientists do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The section on
methodology includes a description of what Advanced Astronomy Camp is like in
addition to a detailed account of the methods I used in researching Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Analysis of the interviews with the campers
and staff reveals several themes in what they thought was valuable about
Advanced Astronomy Camp and the ensuing discussion probes the potential
relevance of these themes to comparable educational situations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Searching for
relevant literature that would enlighten the research on Advanced Astronomy
Camp was very difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Shirley
Brice Heath put it, The third arena of learning, that which takes place beyond
classroom and home, is generally left unattended, minimally supported, and
almost completely unexamined (Heath, 2001).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Indeed, not much has been written about the third arena, including
science camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Furthermore, Advanced
Astronomy Camp is an unusual situation in that it is unlike most science camps
and informal science education in general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Though Camp has elements in common with them, in many ways it has more similarities
to the dynamics of the community youth organizations described by Heath and
others; additionally it has a distinct philosophy of teaching science, one that
might be considered to come closer to the type of inquiry that professional
scientists do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So in order to shed
light onto this educational program and the experiences of the youth there,
this literature review has three primary components: comparative informal
science education (particularly science camps), research on community youth
organizations, and authentic scientific inquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Helping youth go
on in science is very important to society today, especially those considered
to be underrepresented in the field (i.e. girls, specific race and ethnic
groups, and those from lower socioeconomic classes).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>As Kay Andrews (2001) notes about extra educational programs in
the United Kingdom, Research suggests that involvement in science clubs
provides the little bit extra that can be the all-important difference
between going on with science or not (pp. 160-161).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Recognizing this, the National Science Teachers Association
issued a statement describing the ways in which informal science education,
whether in the form of camps, museums, field trips, multiple media (such as
videos and TV), or learning at home, is relevant and needed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Informal science education, they say, can
increase the time students engage in science, extend to the affective,
cognitive, and social realms, provide opportunities for students to form different
sorts of relationships with adults, allow for different learning styles and
multiple intelligences, afford the sharing of moments of intellectual
curiosity between care providers and children, give more direct access to
career role models in the sciences, and emphasize creativity and enrichment
(NSTA, 1998).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>However, although
informal science education is a field containing many programs of different
natures, it is still a relatively little researched area.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its diversity makes it difficult to draw out
common themes and differences in various programs and what makes them
successful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Within the field, museums
and science centers are by far the most studied (Dierking &amp; Martin, 1997).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is clear from the National Science
Foundations website dedicated to informal science education just how
frequently many museums and associated programs are studied as opposed to
longer-term educational programs outside of school.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Since this literature focuses to a large degree on the dynamics
of one-time visits to science exhibits or presentations, I did not find that it
contained much relevance for comparatively extended educational endeavors like
the Advanced Astronomy Camp, which lasted eight days and eight nights.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unfortunately the much smaller body of
literature on science camps, clubs, and other extended programs contains mostly
anecdotal and how-to accounts of how to start your own science program rather
than thorough descriptions, program evaluations, or other research on these
programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> or leadership dynamics
influence the program, and how they assess what children have gained from these
experiences is not described in detail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However there are a handful of descriptive articles that provide
pictures of what can happen at a science camp or related program and these
comprise the focus of the first section of this literature review.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The descriptions that follow give basic
descriptors about these science programs such as the targeted participants and
the programmatic content and length in addition to what is unique about each
experience and the research surrounding it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The GIRLS (gifted,
intelligent, real-life scientists) science camp is directed toward fifteen
fifth- and sixth-grade girls and the older high school girls that help mentor
and teach. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is free for those
accepted into the program though no application process is described except
that the students otherwise would not be able to afford a science camp
experience (Zanelli &amp; Smith, 2000, p. 46).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The students engage in exploratory, hands-on learning through
lessons designed by the participating science teachers and a select group of
female high school science scholars (p. 46) that mentor the girls and are in
turn mentored by the teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The camp
setting allows students more access to the great outdoors and related
activities than a typical school setting but generally the lessons appear to be
quite similar to what might occur in a middle school science class.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The week-long camp (whether residential or
day only is not specified) receives high ratings from participants as well as
parents who believed that their daughters participation  increased their
confidence in understanding science (p. 47).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This article, co-written by one of the science teachers, Zanelli, and
the high school student who worked with her, Smith, is an example of the type
of two-page article typically written about such science camp experiences.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What makes it unusual is the emphasis on
older girls mentoring younger campers and the first-person description by one
of the high school girls, recounting the meaningful and empowering nature of
the camp experience for herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>KIDS (kids
investigating and exploring science), an extended science education program run
by the University of California at Irvine, targets Latino children from lower
income families to provide an engaging and challenging university-based
science camp (Rodriguez, 1998, p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The children range in age from kindergarten through middle school and
learn about the program through the Santa Ana Unified School District.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rodriguez, a professor of Environmental
Studies and the founder of the program, characterizes it as an environmental
framework with enthusiastic parents, compassionate student assistants, and
gifted bilingual teachers (p. 9) with leaders who also include distinguished
minority faculty, serv[ing] as role models and mentors (p. 9).<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The camp emphasizes project-based learning
on topics at the forefront of biology where the students actually envision
themselves as young scientists working side-by-side with the multiple leaders
(p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rodriguez cites improved grades
in school as well as anecdotal comments from principals about students
subsequent leadership in science within their school classrooms as evidence of
the camps positive impact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although
the duration of this day camp and a more detailed description of what actually
occurs on a daily basis are not given, a sustained effort is made to support
students throughout the school year through tutoring and university faculty
visits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is one of the few camps I
found that follows up in some way on students subsequent performances in
school and whose leader is a professional research scientist.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>One example of a
formal program evaluation of a science camp is the CPEP Summer Science Camp for
upper middle school youth (Bruckerhoff &amp; Bruckerhoff, 1996).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The purpose of this five-week day camp is to
increase the number of African-American, Hispanic, Native American, women, and
other underrepresented minority students who pursue college study and careers
in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology (p. 6), seeking to
provide eighth and ninth graders with a hands-on approach to science and
mathematics in addition to language arts, study skills, and career counseling, all
in line with the Connecticut state standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The activities themselves include full lesson plans and homework
assignments, designed and taught by school teachers in line with state
standards, but with a purposeful element of informal relationships between
students and teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A few projects
take place throughout the duration of the camp, including the newspaper which
each student contributes to producing, an example of the emphasis on
collaboration of peers (p. 50).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Evaluations by the students showed a high approval rating but there was
no information on how they were affected after they left the camp nor was it
apparent that the content and format of the camp was ever questioned, only how
much students liked the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A science camp in
Taiwan for seventh graders gifted in math and science had a purposeful
research and curriculum design directed to finding whether students
conceptions of the nature of science (NOS) would change over the course of six
days (Liu &amp; Lederman, 2002).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Twenty-nine gifted students participated for six hours each day in
intensive science inquiry-based activities (p. 115) led by university science
educators, graduate students, and experienced teachers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interestingly enough, there were apparently
no significant changes in students understanding of the nature of
science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One explanation offered for
this was that apparently the participants did not have enough time to be
engaged in more reflective activities and in-depth discussions that have been
shown to help students construct more informed understanding of NOS (p.
121).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another possibility was that the
presence and regular intervention of the students middle school teacher in all
aspects of the camp may have impacted their willingness to engage in new types
of thinking and understanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unlike
the other literature described thus far, Liu and Lederman systematically
pursued a specific research question rather than engaging solely in a
descriptive account of the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They
also had a clear philosophy for the design of science teaching and
inquiry-related activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>An extended
informal science education program that is not a camp is the Young Scholars
Program at The Ohio State University, directed toward academically talented,
economically disadvantaged minority students with the primary goal of
increasing their agricultural literacy (Jones, 1997, p. 663).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This six-year program takes place during the
regular school year and primarily includes field trips, presentations, and
interactions with university faculty from the field of agriculture, culminating
in research groups in twelfth grade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Unlike previous years of the program, the design during the year
described by Jones was changed to be more informal and responsive to students
interests, exposing students to aspects of our field that we hoped would be
interesting, culturally pertinent, and as aesthetically pleasing as possible
(p. 664).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This attention to student
interest (leaders responded directly to students comments on what they would
like to learn) and especially to aesthetic elements is quite unusual in the
literature on informal science education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In addition, purposeful interactions between university students and
faculty who were all female and men of color (p. 663) were emphasized so that
students could have positive role models that broke the image of agriculture
being a white male discipline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Evaluations were done through student essays reflecting on their
experiences, another unusual element, designed to be less intrusive than the
familiar questionnaire or typical evaluation form.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Unlike Liu and Lederman, Jones found that the relaxation of the
content of this educational experience seemed to allow students to interpret
the demonstrations in ways that were more meaningful (p. 676), demonstrating
that the changes made in the program were successful.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The only
description of a well-documented residential camp that I could find was of the
Fairbanks American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) Science Camp,
a camp designed to promote relationships between Alaskan Native American elders
and high school students interested in science (Bradley &amp; Reyes,
2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This article carefully related
the philosophy of the Director and camp activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Unlike almost all the other camps described here, student
activities consisted of self-chosen research projects required to be
scientifically sound and to incorporate elders knowledge (p. 44).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Another unusual characteristic was the
requirement of a significant application in order to attend, including the
students academic record, teacher recommendation, and written essay.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Significant resources, primarily in the form
of computers and teachers, were provided for the students research so that
beyond their own observations or experiments and discussions with the elders,
they could perform comparative research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The primary goals of the camp were to perform solid science and connect
with students native cultures, addressing both the students academic and
developmental needs (p. 42).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Indeed, the
feedback from students and elders in the form of interviews confirms that
cultural connections were made and valued by both generations, and success of
student science projects at local and state science fairs demonstrates the
quality of some of the projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
many respects this camp comes closest to the Advanced Astronomy Camp in that
students send in a serious application for the camp, stay for both nights and
days, and research self-chosen projects with the assistance of the adults
present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
even this smattering of six science camps and related educational programs, it
becomes evident how different the programs are and how sparse the literature of
this field is in demonstrating what can be successful about short-term informal
science education. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The participants
range in age from fifth to twelfth grade, varying in the degree to which
different age groups interact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Only one
camp mentioned any social dynamics between students and then only in the
context of the older students formally mentoring the younger (Zanelli &amp;
Smith, 2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The content varies from
pre-chosen teacher-directed experiments to field trips responsive to student
input to completely student-chosen research projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Seemingly the programs provide opportunities to further science learning
in school but the activities and who chose them were remarkably similar to
school when descriptions were given except in the case of the Fairbanks AISES
Science Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The time allotted for the
programs ranged from 1-5 weeks to select days over the course of the school
year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The article describing the only
residential camp, the Fairbanks AISES Science Camp, did not clarify whether
this aspect of the camp was intentional or integral to the philosophy of the camp
nor what impact it may have had on students, teachers, and elders.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>However, there
were some commonalities among the camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In almost all of the descriptions, there was an emphasis on informal
relationships between students and teachers and on cooperative relationships
among students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a few cases there
was also an interest in drawing students into university settings (Rodriguez,
1998; Jones, 1997; Liu &amp; Lederman, 2002) or at least into contact with
university science faculty in order to provide better role models.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the exception of the camp for gifted
seventh-grade students (Liu &amp; Lederman, 2002), all the other educational
programs were directed toward populations that might not otherwise have access
to science outside the classroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
would be difficult from these descriptions to say what elements might make for
better informal science programs or how one might decide what to include in the
design of a new camp, except for Jones (1997) evaluation that giving students
choice as to the program content was positive and Bradley and Reyes (2000)
conclusions that students benefited from interactions with Native Alaskan
elders in their science research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
might be informative to know what students perceived that they gained from the
programs, how their knowledge and understanding of science grew, what drew them
to the programs in the first place, and how interactions between peers and
leaders affected their experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As
a high school student, Kelly Smith could clearly articulate what she found
positive about her experiences teaching chemistry to younger girls (Zanelli
&amp; Smith, 2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why not discover
the perspectives of more students on what they find interesting or positive
about informal science situations?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Clearly
there are gaps in the literature on longer-term informal science education
programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Valerie Crane (1994) asserts
that informal science learning research has focused on the stimulus rather than
the learner, paid little attention to the context in which learning takes place,
ignored the complex interactions of informal learning, and overlooked the
influence of social mediators on learning (p. 186), but these learning dynamics
have begun to be researched in other areas, namely community youth
organizations and adventure camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Studies of
community youth organizations, while not necessarily dealing with science, have
much in common with the general situation of a residential camp in that they
examine some of the dynamics that make certain organizations more successful
than others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Noting that the primarily
studied aspects of learning in childrens lives are the duo of school and
family, Shirley Brice Heath, R.W. Larson, and several others have begun to
look more closely at what they term a third element, the arena outside of
school and home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Larsons (2000)
interest in this arena began as he searched for situations that helped to
develop intrinsic motivation in adolescents, which he defines as having two
components: wanting to be doing an activity and being invested in it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He found that while such dual interest and
high concentration was lacking in schoolwork and unstructured leisure time, it
was very present in structured voluntary activities, such as sports, arts, and
participation in organizations, in which youth experience the rare combination
of intrinsic motivation in combination with deep attention (p. 170).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Studies on adventure camps are also relevant
to this field because of shared social dynamics and activities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hattie, Marsh, Neill, and Richards (1997)
found that the overall effects from participating in an adventure program not
only lasted but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>increased </i>over time;
something which should draw the attention of any educator.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While small in breadth and primarily
stemming from the work of Shirley Brice Heath and her associates, the research
of the past decade concerning not-often-looked-to community youth organizations
and adventure camps has found commonalities amongst some that suggest what
makes some programs more successful than others: their voluntary nature,
youth-centeredness, a temporal arc of activity with real-world constraints,
informal cross-age relationships, and opportunities for youth to play multiple
roles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Community youth
organizations are organized around their being voluntary: youth choose to come
and select in which activities to participate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>While some might certainly come because of their parents admonitions,
leaders involved in the organizations assert that it is students choices that
bring them and keep them engaged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looking at after-school study support programs in the United Kingdom,
MacBeth, Kirwan, and Myers (2001) found:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Choosing whether
or not to participate and what to participate in opens access to a range of
benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Having the option to choose
from a number of different pleasurable learning activities is itself empowering
and likely to increase self-esteem, even if simply by virtue of being trusted
to make choices. (p. 50)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Bently and Gurumurthy (1999)
reached similar conclusions about the importance of activities reaching youth
in the United Kingdom being voluntary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Another reason why voluntarism is essential is because effective youth
organizations situate their curricula within the youth and not within external
rules or mandates (Heath &amp; McLaughlin, 1994, p. 484).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because the organizations are voluntary,
they must tailor their activities to youths interests although they are not
unstructured or without restraints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This can lead to a sense of greater autonomy for the youth, as their
interests are sought after and met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
educational programs for adolescents are youth-centered, young people learn
quickly in these groups that they are needed resources and not problems in need
of fixing (Heath &amp; McLaughlin, 1994, p.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

input into the choice of activities and consequent participation in them is
seen as essential to the success of the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

positive consequences like changes in youths language use as Heath (1999) documented:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>When an

young learners become embedded in ever widening frames for building future
scenarios  Language development follows from activity and roles that
legitimate membership and the overarching purpose of the group. (p. 72)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Some of the language changes Heath
(1999) found were the use of conditionals (if-then statements), modals (could,
should, and would), strategies to get clarification from others, and varied
genres and voices (youth playing multiple roles and giving multiple
perspectives).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She points these out as
important attributes of the type of problem-solving talk essential to
contemporary work places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Similarly,
MacBeth et al. (2001) discovered that students taking a more active role in
shaping and evaluating the study support programs increased their
identification with, and ownership of, study support (p. 68).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Centering educational programs on youth also
leads to more challenging activities, another key element in successful
programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Heath
(2001) describes common dynamics that community youth organizations share with
scientific research laboratories: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Work takes place
within a temporal arc, with phases that move from planning and preparation
for the task ahead, to practice and deliberation along with ample
trial-and-error learning, to final intensive readiness for production or
performance; and, ultimately, to a culminating presentation of the work that
has gone before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Evaluation by
outsiders, peers, and professional critics follows along with some down time
before the next cycle of work begins. (p. 13)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>In a school classroom there is
often little time for such extensive projects where students participate from
beginning to end and have the added challenge of receiving feedback from
professional outsiders, augmenting the risk involved in the activity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In their meta-analysis of adventure programs
in Australia and North America, Hattie et al. (1997) also found that one significant
aspect of adventure camps is the planned transfer of experience and decisions
encountered during the earlier parts of the course to critical decisions later
in the program (p. 57), so that participants experienced the consequences of
decisions made early at the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their
analysis also pointed to the challenging, yet reachable goals that were set for
participants, similar to longer-term risky endeavors that teens face in
youth-centered community organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Further, they point out that feedback is the most powerful single
moderator that improves affective and achievement outcomes (p. 58), finding in
their meta-analysis of over 300 adventure programs, that the most powerful
effect was related to feedback (p. 58).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This element of
feedback by leaders, outside experts and peers helps provide real-world
constraints to youth activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Similarly, in many youth organizations the continuation of the program
relies on the youths abilities to draw in funding or audiences for their
exhibits or plays; the decisions they make determine the future of the
organization just as they would in real-life workplaces.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So the feedback serves a very real need,
both in the process of working through a project, and in the success of final
presentations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another strength
of community youth organizations and arguably some informal science programs is
the opportunity for informal relationships between adults and students and
between different ages of students to form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>MacBeth et al. (2001) assert that such informality eased the ability of
adults to offer both praise and criticism without the social sanction that is
often associated with being singled out in school (p. 63).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Heath (1999) points out that times when youth
and adults work together are rapidly decreasing along with the inherent
language development that used to occur in such contexts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She found that in community organizations
where adults and youth worked together on a common task:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>[Adults help]
enable youth to be self-conscious in their use of language, reflective and
self-critical about what their discourse does and does not accomplish, and
gradually comfortable and habituated in their language forms.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather than learned helplessness in
language, the youth take on a learned helpfulness approach to oral and written
language and to the type of information, argumentation, and presentation that
accomplish work. (p. 71)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Also significant are the
opportunities for youth of different ages to work with each other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cross-age communities of practice enhance
everyones role, since everyone has an opportunity to be both apprentice and
expert, teacher and learner (Heath &amp; McLaughlin, 1994, p. 485).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is similar to real work places such as
science laboratories where members range in age and experience, and novices
work along with older more experienced scientists and artists, and often with
experts who have outside professional identities (Heath, 2001, p. 13).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In community youth organizations where
students participate for several consecutive years, there are many
opportunities for youth to learn from each other, whether formally designated
as teachers, or simply passing on experiences from one to another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Within
this community youth assume real roles in the planning, organization, and
management of the program, and usually move to fill more than just one role,
whether it is calling for travel arrangements, leading a dance class for
younger students, providing constructive criticism to a peer on a piece of art,
or brainstorming ideas with the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Filling these sorts of roles is crucial to equip youth for future
opportunities in other workplaces, in developing the sorts of language
abilities discussed earlier (Heath, 1999), and in making educational programs
intrinsically youth-centered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Speaking
specifically to the uniqueness that arts-based organizations provide, Heath and
Roach (1999) articulate the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Young people in
arts-based organizations gain practice in thinking and talking as adults.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They play important roles in their organizations;
they have control over centering themselves and working for group excellence in
achievement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their joint work with
adults and peers rides on conversations that test and develop ideas, explicate
processes, and build scenarios of the future. (p. 26)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The categorization of the
characteristics important to successful youth organizations described above is
artificial but hopefully useful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is
interesting to note some of the differences between these organizations and the
informal science programs described earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>While they both stress informal relationships between youth and adults,
there is a stronger emphasis on collaboration of peers, choice, and high
involvement of youth in leading and contributing to activities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also fascinating is the comparison Heath
(2001) draws between the youth organizations and professional science
laboratories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the collaboration,
talk, work, and inquiry found in science labs is desirable, what positive
outcomes might similar scientific communities for youth provide?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Might science camps incorporate the temporal
arcs of activity, aesthetics, constraints, and sense of community found in
community youth organizations and professional work places?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So far in this
paper I have reviewed recent literature available on science camps and
presented some of the dynamics of successful community youth organizations in
order to provide a framework of comparison for research on Advanced Astronomy
Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet while these programs give a backdrop
of comparable education situations they do not supply much in the way of
thinking about the scientific content of the Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Since one of the primary agendas of Advanced Astronomy Camp is to
facilitate youth-designed astronomy research projects, delving into recent
literature concerned with the scientific inquiry in schools is relevant to the
scope of this review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, it is
not within the differences between the thought and activities of professional
scientists to current science curricula in schools.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">   </span>It is common knowledge that the practices of professional
scientists are different than the experiences of youth in science classes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How are these experiences different?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How important is it that youth understand or
experience the thought processes of professional scientists?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Many researchers
are attempting to design and research science curricula that come closer to how
professional scientists think about and perform research.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The way science is taught in most schools
doesnt help students understand what scientists do and how they think (James
Stewart as quoted in Black, 2002, p. 4).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>One group of science education researchers attempting to do this is
Stewart, Cartier, and Rudolph (2001), who have been part of a large project
through the National Center for Improving Student Learning and Achievement in
Mathematics and Science (NCISLA) to use scientific modeling to help students
develop the type of complex and tentative thinking that professionals use.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They found that when models have been a
focus of classroom attention, students have learned that they are tentative constructions
that explain the natural world and that their usefulness is dependent upon the
kinds of questions they enable scientists to ask and answer (p. 7).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This type of instruction differs from simple
hands-on curricula because of the critical thinking students must develop in
order to explain and predict their data and be consistent with other relevant
models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When this type of thought
happens, Lehrer and Schauble have found increased student interest, ownership
of their work, and deeper understanding of content (as quoted in Foster, 1998,
p. 3), characteristics not unlike those found in successful community youth
organizations researched by Heath and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Assuming that
thinking like professional scientists is a positive goal, Chinn and Malhotra
(2002) analyzed the complexity of thought that professional scientists use to
do their research in contrast to that encouraged by both textbook-driven
inquiry and curricula developed by science education researchers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Analyzing simple inquiry projects in textbooks,
including experiments, observations and illustrations, in comparison to
specific research projects of various scientists, they found that the textbook
inquiry projects differed in the ways they approached generating research
questions, designing studies, making observations, explaining results,
developing theories, and studying research reports (pp. 183-186).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More specifically, some of the complex
scientific reasoning not often a part of school science tasks included: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>They concluded that simple inquiry
tasks may not only fail to help students learn to reason scientifically, they
may also foster a nonscientific epistemology in which scientific reasoning is
viewed as simple, certain, algorithmic, and focused at a surface level of
observation (p. 190).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In addition, Chinn
and Malhotra (2002) also found differences between research-driven curricula
and what they termed authentic scientific inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In their comparisons most research-developed tasks, while
building greater depth and self-generated thought in students than the
textbooks, do not attain all of the complexity of thought found in their
analyses of professional scientists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For instance, one significant aspect of being a scientist is generating
your own research question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While none
of the selected textbook tasks included this, only 12% of the 24
researcher-generated activities studied did so.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In only 2% of the textbook activities and 50% of the
researcher-developed tasks did students choose their own variables to
investigate and only activities included this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Some other areas of significant difference between research-generated
scientific inquiry and professional scientific inquiry included consideration
of methodological flaws, developing relatively complex controls, making
multiple observations, using analog models, and studying expert research
reports (pp.201-203).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, each
characteristic of authentic scientific inquiry that Chinn and Malhotra
identified was met by one of more of the twenty-six research-developed tasks
they studied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Chinn and Malhotra
(2002) conclude that much work remains to be done to transform schools into
places that nurture epistemologically authentic science inquiry and call for
the creation of curricula that will support and develop that complexity of
thought (p. 214).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their study can serve
as a starting point for comparison and evaluation of whether students are
really being taught to think like scientists when this goal is considered
desirable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While many efforts are being
made to nurture this complexity of thought in schools, there remain
opportunities outside of school that might be used to further the development
of scientific thought in children and youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the literature on science camps above,
many current programs primarily consist of the same simple inquiry tasks done
in schools that educational researchers are trying to move away from.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In his theory of alchemy, Thomas Popkewitz
(1998, 2002) has noted the way academic disciplines as done by professionals in
universities or workplaces become transformed into very different, often
simplistic school subjects that are seen as more palatable for children and
youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whereas disciplines involve
competing sets of ideas about research  school subjects tend to treat
knowledge as uncontested and unambiguous content for children to learn or solve
problems with (1998, p. 27).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Popkewitz
asserts that this alchemy of disciplines can promote a limiting psychologizing
and managing of students souls in school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If the inquiry tasks generally encouraged in schools both teach a
simplistic epistemology to students and limit them in the ways Popkewitz
discusses, is it any accident that one of the strengths of community youth
organizations is that they encourage youth to take full responsibilities in
carrying out activities of importance to the local community with real limits
and constraints?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How can we make more
of these equipping and mentally challenging opportunities available in areas
outside of arts, sports, and service, the primary makeup of youth
organizations?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Granted, the alchemy
of disciplines is inevitable in classrooms and informal educational programs,
but what would be the effects of developing activities that include the type of
reasoning that Chinn and Malhotra (2002) identified as part of scientific
thinking? <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></p>

many educators see the importance of developing such scientific reasoning in
students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet how this is to be done is
still a question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Significant in Chinn
and Malhotras research (2002) is their conclusion that research-driven
inquiry, while a definite improvement on standard textbook tasks, does not go
far enough in schools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And even these
curricula are probably far less common in instructional activities than the
simple inquiry tasks propounded in standard science textbooks.<span

above did not come near to the type of curricula that science education
researchers are designing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Could not a
third arena provide an additional opportunity for pursuing more complex
science inquiry?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Might more time or
access to professional equipment and technology provide the opportunity for
students to generate their own questions, design their own experiments, choose
multiple variables, deal with methodological flaws in design and equipment,
develop theories for what happens and why, and make sense of comparisons with
other relevant research?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Might this not
only better equip students academically but also empower them in the way Lehrer
and Schauble (as quoted in Foster, 1998) described?<span style="mso-spacerun:

tests instructional approaches for fostering the development of such complex
strategies (p. 213).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Researching the
Advanced Astronomy Camp is just such an opportunity as the campers create
research questions, develop proposals, and with help from the professional and
student scientists at their disposal flesh out theories for how their data
makes sense with what the rest of the scientific world is saying.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This is not the
only reason for studying Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:

claim to be beneficial for students affective and academic development.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Heath (2001) also calls for more research in
the third arena:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Processes of
community youth organizations need studies that will detail how the people who
participate learn, what they acquire by way of skills and knowledge (p.
15).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My research of Advanced Astronomy
Camp has the potential to be just such an opportunity, adding a unique
viewpoint by interviewing the youth directly about what they feel they learned
and found valuable in the Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Larson
(2000) too appeals for research on the processes of learning that occurs in
structured youth activities and is also interested in how leaders of such
programs can best facilitate the development of youth: Leaders face the
fundamental problematic of allowing participants actions to be self-directed,
voluntary, and intrinsically motivated, yet also structured and challenging
enough that participants are stretched into new domains of complexity (p. 16).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Interviewing the Director and
counselors of Advanced Astronomy Camp may help to answer this question, at
least as it pertains to this particular program that is purported to be very
positive by the youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Camp is
potentially closer to professional astronomy in its access to scientists,
telescopes and related technology, and student-designed research than many
school opportunities and science camps allow and therefore poses a chance to
begin to pursue the questions Chinn and Malhotra (2002) raise.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This research on Advanced Astronomy Camp has
the potential to fill in one more gap in the research on informal science
education, third arena programs for youth, and scientific inquiry.</p>

activity of the day is brunch at noon with counselors preparing the food (with

afternoon includes different groups stories from the previous nights
observing, a daily Fermi problem (an estimation problem such as at any given
time how many flat tires are there in the United States?), one or more
lectures delivered by Don or a counselor (Spectroscopy &amp; Light, Lives &amp;
Deaths of Stars, The ~Ologies of Mars), and time to work on projects or debates
with team members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Dinner is usually
around 6pm (or whenever the pizzas are fully cooked given the high altitude)
followed by watching the sunset and competing to see who can find Venus,
Jupiter and the stars first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then it is
To the observatories! (a favorite quote from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

imaging and a sophisticated computer program for finding objects.<span

</span>This explains why the distribution of age is not equal (6 older and 4
younger campers).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, I did
not try to group the youth according to combinations of age, gender, or
experience due to the complexity of that process, so there are no young males
or females who had not attended Camp previously in the subjects of this
study.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Actually, this is reflective of
the thirty-three campers: there were no women going into their first two years
of high school who had not attended Camp before and only a few of the young men
were new to Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It may be that prior
experience at Beginning Astronomy Camp influences youth, especially women, to
attend Advanced Camp at a younger age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Except for the
Director and myself, I initially randomly selected half of the six staff to
interview.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However two more counselors
were added to the staff during the week before Camp, so I chose to select one
additional counselor in order to include half of the staff in the study.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Conveniently, the originally selected
counselors and the Director were evenly distributed among four of the five
telescope stations at Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since only
one telescope station was not represented in my original random selection, I
chose the counselor situated at the final site as my final staff interview.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Originally
conceived as a small-scale program evaluation, my study draws on two primary
theoretical sources that inform the data collection: illuminative evaluation as
envisioned by Parlett and Hamilton (1972) and constructivist grounded theory
(Charmaz, 2000).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because of the limits
and scope of the study I did not aim to completely understand and evaluate
every aspect of Advanced Astronomy Camp as an educational program but rather
chose to focus on the perceptions of the campers and staff, believing that
their opinions and experiences could enlighten why Camp has a reputation for
success with the youth who attend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Although I had a few ideas of what might make Camp successful,
semi-structured interviews were designed to let the participants give their own
perspectives and tell their own stories about Advanced Astronomy Camp, giving
voice to [the] respondents (Charmaz, 2000, p. 510).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Drawing on the idea of simultaneous collection and analysis of
data (Charmaz, 2000) from grounded theory, I eventually added two questions to
the camper interviews with based on themes that I perceived were arising.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The two questions I added concerned campers
thoughts and evaluations of the Mars Sample Return Debates and their
interactions with staff members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
first three campers I interviewed spoke to these themes without my questioning
them directly, and they had such strong opinions on them that I made sure that
I asked every subsequent camper about them, so all campers spoke to the additional
questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Though interviews
served as my primary data for analysis, I also collected data by serving as a
counselor and taking field notes at Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Reminded by Parlett and Hamilton (1972) that
the researcher is concerned to familiarize himself thoroughly with the
day-to-day reality of the setting or setting he is studying (p. 18) and that
it is important to situate qualitative research in historical and cultural
context (Charmaz, 2000), I sought to immerse myself in the world of Astronomy
Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To this purpose I also assisted
as a counselor at the Beginning and Educator Astronomy Camps, which preceded
and followed the Advanced Astronomy Camp in June 2002.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This heavy involvement allowed me to develop
a level of trust and relationship with the campers and counselors I interviewed
as I served alongside them cooking, cleaning, teaching, and helping with
observing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This also afforded me many
additional opportunities for conversation with all of the participants and a
sense of common language, openness, and co-constructing of meaning during the
interviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span

semi-structured interviews with the campers were tape-recorded over several
days both in person and by phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Campers were informed of their random selection for interviewing on the
fifth day of Camp and given the list of interview questions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the Camp was packed with activities, I
interviewed as many of the selected campers as possible during the last three
days of Camp at times that best fit their needs and desires.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interviews were conversational as I followed
the interview questions, pursued answers for better description, and clarified
questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As mentioned above, after
the first few interviews I noted a couple of themes arising in camper remarks
and added them in as questions: relationships with the staff and reactions to
the Mars Sample Return Debates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All but
two interviews were conducted in person; these took place over the phone within
two days of Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
five semi-structured interviews with the counselors and the Director were
recorded in person at their convenience over the month following Advanced

the questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each counselor had
access to the questions before his or her interview, which lasted 30 to 65
minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
the interviews were complete, I transcribed them and mailed the transcriptions

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Influenced
by grounded theory, I used a two-step open coding process (Charmaz, 2000) to
analyze the interviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After
transcribing the interviews I had a few ideas of what the some of the
categories ensuing from them might be, so I coded the interviews of the campers
and staff separately under those initial categories.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The categories for campers were the importance of peer
relationships, a sense of responsibility and empowerment with equipment and
with choice, a changing understanding of science, and positive informal
relationships with staff. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The initial
categories for staff were teaching science that mirrored professional science,
developing campers confidence, filling a niche at Camp, being scientists, and
demonstrating a general awareness of what campers took away from Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the process of coding both camper and
staff interviews, the categories grew more defined as sub-categories arose
within them and outlying responses began to become clear.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After outlining these new sub-themes I went
back to the transcripts for a second coding to see how these held with the
interviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While the interview
questions were originally directed toward several ideas I had about what
campers and staff might find valuable about Camp, the themes growing from the
conversations did not necessarily stem from particular questions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For instance, campers shared about the
importance of their peers at Camp in answer to questions about what they took
away from Camp, what the best aspects of Camp were, and what they learned about
science as well as direct questions about their peers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore instead of showing themes of
answers to specific interview questions, the analysis proceeds from one theme
to another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
analyzing the interviews, I counted how many campers or staff members spoke to
each theme and sub-theme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of the
campers and staff interviewed said something related to each over-arching
theme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In discussing the sub-themes and
outlying responses I use all when every camper or counselor spoke to an
issue, most for 80-90%, several for 40-70%, and a few for 30%.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hopefully this will clarify the analysis.</p>

kind of interest in astronomy, there were several different answers to this
question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Two students, Pam and Stacy,
said they were very interested and good in science at school, and their
teachers recommended Camp to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Brian

from the internet and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sky &amp; Telescope</i>.<span

either through a booklet of activities for gifted and talented students or
through <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Astronomy</i> magazine.<span

internet looking for a summer camp that would allow them to do astronomy; James
because he wanted to find peers he could talk with about science and Kris
because she desired something less expensive than Space Camp but just as
interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The students who had been
to an Astronomy Camp before each wanted to further their experiences and
continue learning; the appeal of Advanced Camp was increased time on the telescopes
and the lure of interesting projects.</p>

counselors why they came to Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:

give back something to the youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One
counselor experienced Advanced Camp as a camper years previously and wanted to
see another side of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another found
the experience lots of fun and the opportunity to do something meaningful for
teens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One said it was a way to give
back to the community and another just loved sharing astronomy. <span

The kids who come here are all kids who want to be coming here and who like
have an interest in astronomy and who arent going to spend the entire night,
just, well waiting for kids to do something all nightits a lot of fun to be
learning stuff with kids who think along the same patterns as you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kevin: I was a
little, not sure I wanted to come, because every camp Ive been to before this
has been just terrible, and uh, but, I thought this, this one sounded different
than those, because, since you actually had to write an essay to get in and it
would be kids who wanted to be here rather than parents forcing kids to be
here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Most
of the campers also expressed a profound sense of commonality they felt with
their Camp peers, mostly due to similar interests in astronomy.<span

thoughtful conversations, contrasting these relationships with their peers back
home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In answer to the question, What
are some of the most significant things that youre going to take with you from

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Probably the understanding
that there are people out there like me Like Im kind of known as the resident
nerd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And, like I dont shy away from
that title, except that, it, Im like the only one around like it.  And, like
even when I was chatting with people on the internet before Camp, it it kinda
suddenly hit me that Im not the only one out there like me.<span

alone anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Adrienna said, Its just kind of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
addition to a fun, positive atmosphere and a strong sense of not being alone,
all the campers voiced ways that they learned from their peers.<span

answer to how their peers influenced their experiences at Camp:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Adrienna: They can
also push you to do better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And teach
you how to do stuff that you dont know how to doYou kind of learn about other
peoples opinions, like the whole thing about, Did the Big Bang happen?And
you also get like, to know more about what you think is right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Pam: Well,  last
year I came and, and I, I knew some astronomy, but not a lot and they helped
me, so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I mean, I came here and I
realized, I know nothing, [laugh] you know, and instead of just being arrogant about
it and saying yeah, well I know this and this and this, [they] helped me so
much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was, it was amazing, you
know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I learned so much and, um, they
influenced me to know more.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Telling a story about a significant

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>I remembered, like
on the second night, we were out playing with the 10-inch, and I was just
looking out into the sky, and I remember somebody, I dont know who it was,
came over to me and started pointing stuff out, like constellations and stuff I
didnt know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And, I I just thought that
was the coolest thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I didnt ask
anybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I didnt do anything like
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They just started showing it to

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Campers
also articulated a sense of responsibility and empowerment at the opportunity
to use the equipment and technology at Advanced Astronomy Camp and choose their
own research projects and other activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the first coding I initially noted their speaking about privilege
in various aspects of participating in Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the second coding it became clearer that camper responses about
privilege and responsibility related to a sense of empowerment with regards to
the two specific areas mentioned above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The choices that campers spoke about concerned choosing their own
projects and their use of time at Camp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
of the campers spoke positively about using the equipment and technology at
Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Camper opinions about the main
strengths of Advanced Astronomy Camp are expressed below: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>James: Just the
chance to get to use all this equipment, I mean, how many kids can say, yeah I
get to use a sixty-mil, a sixty-inch telescope to look at a quasar sixty
thousand light years away?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I mean,
that! [laughter]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kevin: The
hands-on aspect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Letting us use
expensive equipment that most astronomers would kill to use.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And it puts you in a position like, wow, you
know, I cant believe Im using this, I cant believe Im getting to do
thisjust learning how to use it, and, you know, being able to say that I could
work, you know, forty-inch telescope better than, maybe some astronomers out
there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Stacy: Definitely
the strong point, the equipment and the resources.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I mean, theres a strong point there!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Just with all the telescopes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Its phenomenal, how much time we had on them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I mean, we got to use the spectrograph, the things that counts
photons, the err luminosity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Campers
also spoke highly about how great they felt choosing their own projects and
being trusted with relative freedom and responsibility on the mountain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Pam: The second
strongest point, I think is theres so many, um, the freedom we have, and like,
letting us do our projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You know,
its not, youre gonna do this project, and everything.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We form our own groups, we have our own
ideas, they tell us yes or no, but if they say no, they say, well why dont you
try this, or this isnt going to work because of that, so you could do a
different angle. And um, the projects, I mean seriously.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And yeah, and theres no other place where
you could, you know, do a project like this, at seventeen years old.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You just cant, you know?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ralph: I liked
finding projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like, the project to
find SS433 was very interesting and we kind of came up with it ourselves And
it actually worked, which was amazing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sarah: [The staff]
dont act like, Well we are in charge and you have to do what we say, an you
know, be here at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its sort
of more, we need to know that you are on the mountain, please stay on the
mountain [laughter].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I mean then,
and there are a lot more kids who are very responsible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>This last quote is interesting
because Sarah articulated that the freedom given on the mountain helped kids be
more responsible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This fits with my own
experience at Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The youth were
given a few basic rules and a great deal of choice in what they did and seemed
to be empowered by those choices and more responsible because of them.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One
of the interview questions asked how campers understanding of science grew or
changed as a result of participating in Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Transcripts revealed two basic themes in
this regard: new knowledge about astronomy or science in general, and learning
astronomy as it related to doing real science.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
the campers spoke of the new knowledge they gained, such as learning how to
operate telescopes, use right ascension and declination coordinates to find
objects in the sky, and find constellations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I have categorized this theme as basic knowledge, though beneath the
surface some of these subjects require deeper understanding.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For instance, using right ascension,
declination, and sidereal time to find objects requires a spatial and geometric
understanding of the sky and how it appears to rotate as the night goes
on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While these pieces of knowledge may
appear simple, most of the youth took several days to feel comfortable applying
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Stacy articulated this gain and
application of basic knowledge as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Its definitely
changed my understanding of astronomy cause basically I had this big gaping
hole in my knowledge of science: astronomy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>So now I have an idea of what a lot of the um, objects are.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Messier objects, you know, right ascension,
and declination, so, now I know how to track the sky with um, sidereal time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Throughout
Camp there is an underlying theme of engaging in scientific pursuits that are
similar to the kinds of work professional scientists do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Called guest astronomers, campers stay in
the dorms that astronomers use regularly, generate research questions, design
projects, gather, analyze, and interpret data, make research presentations, and
even clean up after meals in the tiny kitchen astronomers use.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of the youth made comments about what
they learned from doing their own science projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Within this larger sub-theme of science, campers articulated
three other themes: developing complexity of thought, practical constraints of
scientific research, and the inter-relationship of multiple academic
disciplines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Most youth
demonstrated developing complexity of thought about science  that there is
more to science than they had previously thought. Consider the following
quotes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Pam: Theres so
many challenges that you gotta break through, theres so many unknownsyou
learn how really hard it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And were
constantly discovering new things that weve, we discover them but we dont
know what they are, and that just, thats great.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ralph: I get to
see all the steps involved[like] how you use information you get to find some
other information that you want to knowSuch as, finding this [object], taking
this spectrum and finding out what spectral lines are the largest and
interpreting that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sarah: Like the
red shift blue shift We might have mentioned it [in school], but we never
really learned it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And here we learn
about like the pro- the electrons jumping; we dont really learn about that,
the electrons changing fields in school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And its, just like learning that because they jump, the wave-length
changes and different parts get absorbed to get the energy to do the jump, or
give off the energy and just.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That we
could get to that stuff instead of simply the electrons go down and up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its just it makes me respect it a lot
more, I think.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
campers also addressed the reality of practical circumstances that affected
their research such as lacking time to finish their projects to their ideal,
having mechanical difficulties, and making human errors that affected their end
results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like the importance of peer
relationships and how excited they were to use equipment or design their own
projects, the comments relating to practical realities of science came up in
many contexts during interviews, especially in memorable stories about Camp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Brian: Its
interesting [regarding the Mars Debate] cause it, it lets you, I mean realize
what the people in NASA have to go through to, you know, make a project work,
you know all the back and forth and all that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>James: So my job
was that I was the guy that had to do the paddle and constantly tweak it to try
to keep in on the slit for like, uh, you know like, a dozen half, a dozen ten
minute exposures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So, so I would sit
there for you know like ten minutes with my eye glued to this eyepiece
desperately trying to keep in on the slit when you cant see the slit and can
hardly see the object, and [laugh] so it was really rough.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I think probably thats probably what
Ill remember most, just sitting there for you know ten minute exposures with
my neck cramping up and desperately trying to guess where the line is, and so
so yeah but uh, in the end it was it was definitely worth it because we, we got
the data we needed so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Kris: Like I never
realized there was so much work that went into those people who end up with
articles in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sky &amp; Tel</i>Like [they
have to] do all those, like let alone, get telescope time, but they sit and sit
behind a telescope for eight hours a night, and, then they have to, like sit
around a computer for three times that to figure out what it was they were
looking at.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And um, I never realized
there was so much work that went into it all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And I mean, even despite all the work and all the, the hard times and
everything, it was still, it was still awesome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Only
a few campers spoke about how multiple disciplines relate in one field.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They articulated a realization from Camp
that astronomy was not a pure discipline but contained math, physics,
chemistry, geology, and other subjects that all related to each other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Pam: I dont want
to go to just get straight into physics and astronomy and just do this and
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I want to view all this other
stuff and try to tie it in with astronomy, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I wanna take engineering classes, I wanna do this, I wanna do
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sarah: Then you
just need to know so many different things to be able to do basic science that
you think you need to know astronomy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>No!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You need to know physics and
 and chemistry, and then you get into Mars you get geology astrobiology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the first few interviews, I found that campers mentioned the staff often in
relating their positive experiences at Camp, so I added a question asking
campers how they felt about the staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>All of the youth talked positively about the informal relationships they
developed with the staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Three
dimensions of these relationships came out as sub-themes: approachability,
knowledge, and promotion of camper confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>All campers discussed how the informal relationships helped them
approach staff for questions and make themselves understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Stacy: The main
strengths?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think the counselors
relationship with the campers. Its its really a relaxed atmosphere, really
comfortable, one in which everyones equal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>So its its really great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No
ones afraid to ask questions, or make suggestions, or things like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sarah: And also
theres the first name thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Don.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That makes it much more informal and then,
its a lot easier to ask questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And
like, all the lectures where were sitting on the ground, that make it a lot
more open; you dont feel when youre asking a question like you need to have
it halfway already figured out by the time you ask itbut when you find
something you dont know, its likeits definitely its not oh thats bad,
its okay lets explain it then, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Todd: You guys all
have really helping attitudes, like your positive feedback and stuff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Campers also
shared enthusiastically about how much the staff knew and how well they
explained things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>James: Paris the

so much sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Several of the
campers also spoke about how the staff promoted their confidence by helping
them figure out answers themselves, making them do the work at the telescopes,
asking them to share knowledge first before answering questions, and not
over-simplifying answers to questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:3.0pt;line-height:200%'>Kevin:
When we worked in the telescope with Ben, any mistake we made, he wouldnt tell
us what we had done, wouldnt tell us what we were doing wrong.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wed get weird numbers and be like, What is
this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He wouldnt say a thing, so we
had to do it all, and then hed just ask a question, Well can you see this,
[with] the moon in your way?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From that
wed be able to work it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So it wasnt
like they were taking over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were
having us do everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So it was very
[good] for our learning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
addition to the common themes described above, there were several outlying
responses that I found during the coding of the camper interviews.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These were issues that one to five youth
discussed which stood out as important to their Camp experiences and why they
thought Advanced Astronomy Camp exceeded all of their expectations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They include experiencing the beauty of the
night-time sky at Camp, contrasting Camp experiences with school experiences,
remarking on how much the staff gives, mentioning issues of gender, and
commenting on particular peer dynamics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Several
of the youth interviewed spoke of the wonder of astronomy and the night-time
sky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were amazed at the beauty of
the things they saw through the telescopes as well as the clear star-lit
sky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Stacy, a camper from a very
populated area of the country where light pollution hinders seeing many stars,
said it well:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ah, just seeing
the Saturn Nebula was amazing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its
amazing those things really do exist, theyre just so beautiful, I mean big
colorful, clouds of gas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And Im also
gonna remember the first time I looked up into the sky and saw the Milky
Way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The very first time I saw a
meteor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first time I saw a
satellite, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Uh, well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ive never seen any of those things before,
so that was just beautiful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The other campers made similar
comments about the aesthetic of being out under the stars on a lonely mountain,
or looking through a telescope and seeing such marvelous things so many
millions of miles away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Several
of the campers also made direct, unsolicited remarks contrasting school with
Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One example
included a negative experience with one science teacher being repaired by the
positive experiences at Camp, renewing the young womans interest in science
and confirming her ability in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Four
other campers specifically said that the staff at Camp gave much clearer, in
depth, and satisfactory answers to their questions than teachers either could
or would.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In every case youth spoke
enthusiastically about learning experiences at Camp and less enthusiastically
about their experiences at school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Bridging
off the earlier stated theme about relationships with staff, two youth
specifically recounted not just the great rapport of the staff but the
sacrifices they saw staff giving in order to serve them at Advanced Astronomy
Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Pam said in answer to what she
thought were the strengths of Camp:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Um, the teachers,
the counselors, Don. [laugh] I mean, you know like, he just goes out of his way
to do everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I just think  hes
very underappreciated for that, and uh, that upsets me, like a lot.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I mean even throughout the year, it was,
it was great, because Id email him with some question in November and he
didnt have to answer it, and, you know, he was like, Well try this, and if I
didnt get the answer he wouldnt give up on meUm, and that because theyre
taking their whole summer to deal with teenagers and thats, thats awesome,
because they dont have to do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They could be doing their own research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They could be on a foreign exchange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But no, theyre in Arizona [laugh].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>You know, helping teenagers attempt to understand something about
astronomy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I think thats the
strongest point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Here Pam alludes to her experiences
during the year between her summers at Astronomy Camp and how much she felt Don
and the counselors gave during Camp itself. James, a newcomer to Astronomy
Camp, also commented on how much the staff gave: getting little sleep and
helping with questions or data analysis at all hours of the day and night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Only
one camper referred to any gender issues at Advanced Astronomy Camp, Pam, who
spoke of her expectations coming into Advanced Camp the first year and how
relieved she was that she was not the only female like she usually is in her
classes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Well I like when I
came, I thought seriously, like last year, before, before the Camp, I was like
really nervous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was like Im going to
be the only female, Im going to be with all these nerds, and Im just going to
like suffer on this mountain top in the middle of the Arizona desert, you
know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I was, I was really worried
because Ive always been the only female in everything Ive done, you know.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I really, I seriously was worried about
that Its great to see that there were more girls than guys.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was like, I can dig this!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You know?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sarah
also made two interesting outlying comments unique to her interview about the
dynamics she saw between the youth at Camp and her growing understanding of
science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Beyond the commonality that
meant so much to most of her peers, she described another way she was
influenced by not being the only smart one at Camp:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>The main problem
is just that all the kids are used to being the smart ones. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>And then they discover that they are not the
smart one at Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We are one of 33
kids who are here and whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And,
kids wont believe everything you say here and you can get very angry when you
debate it and defend your answers more than you really have to I think its
good for us to learn to deal with it were all used to being the smart one and
then we discover that were not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its
sort of a shock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Sarah also explained her changed
conceptions of science in the greatest detail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The following excerpt is another example of how some of the youth
contrasted their school experiences with Advanced Astronomy Camp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>[It] makes you
understand why people back then didnt just simply go, oh there must be
electrons circling around nucleuses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Cause like in science they make it sound so easy you wonder why they
didnt know it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But now you discover
theres a whole lot more there to understandI mean, just, that they [the
textbooks and teachers] simplify it so much and you dont realize how much
there is going into that one statement and you dont care.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thats what.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I was saying this with my, one of the science teachers cause he
would simplify things to the point and then, hed ask for a question,<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>hed make such an answer like an answer
that would make you think there was nothing left to know about it, that it
didnt matter any more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its a done
field sort of thing and, its not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Like
the coding of the camper interviews, general categories emerged during the
initial analysis of the interviews with the staff, which became more defined in
a second coding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All five of the staff
members interviewed spoke about the importance of doing and teaching science
the mirrors how professional astronomers research, developing confidence in the
campers, filling their own niches in their roles at Camp, and being scientists
in addition to demonstrating fairly accurate knowledge about some of the things
that campers took away with them from a week at Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Beyond this, most of the staff also
discussed the aesthetics of being on the mountain top and the beauty of the
night sky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, the Director
touched on subjects that the counselors did not mention, including overarching
goals for the counselors as well as the campers at Advanced Astronomy Camp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One
of the primary goals of Advanced Astronomy Camp as described by all the staff
is having the youth do real science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>As Paris said, They were actually doing astronomy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Two sub-themes emerged within the theme
about science: learning the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>process</i>
of doing science and experiencing the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>time,
error, and difficulty</i> involved in gathering and analyzing data.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was important
to the staff that campers decide on their own research questions, delve into a
project using the facilities and equipment available, and bring their
self-designed project to completion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These aspects are part of learning the processes of science:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:3.0pt;line-height:200%'>Don:
I want them to see, to experience the whole process of science, from the start
of an idea to getting real observations, to maybe fighting with equipment,
struggling with the interpretation of the data, and making a presentation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I would like them to see that science is
fun, its uh, a process of exploration, its not too much different from what
people do in ordinary life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ben: Students get
that opportunity to study astronomy, in the most real environment that you can
get The interacting galaxies group, they said well, were gonna do this, new
thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So they went on and made a
proposal for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They went on to the
telescope, they did it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And they took
the data, they reduced it, and they presented it, what they found.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It, you know, it allows creativity too,
where you get to create what youre gonna do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Decide, hey, were gonna do this and do it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It makes it more like real science</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Part
and parcel of this process is experiencing the unexpected difficulties innate
in research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While the staff advised
youth during the process of creating and submitting project proposals they
purposely only made suggestions to the youth, allowing them to make mistakes in
their projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I witnessed several
times when suggestions were initially ignored until the campers realized for
themselves why they were having difficulty getting relevant data.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Besides human error much of the difficulty
youth experienced was due to sharing time on the telescopes, having bad sky
conditions, and running into computer difficulties, things that all astronomers
must face in their research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Amanda: One of the
things about Camp was, how you actually do the process of asking a question
about something, sort of making an, an estimate of whether  answering those
questions [is] going to be possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And going to the telescope, figure out, you know theres a thing you
didnt anticipate that you would need, and then you get to the data, trying to
figure out the best way to look at it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Developing Confidence<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
were two interview questions directed to discover whether and how the staff try
to develop confidence or community in the youth at Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interestingly, in general the staff did not
try to instill a sense of community but saw their work as building confidence in
the campers which in turn could lead to a sense of community.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Staff articulated two strategies of
stimulating confidence in the youth: drawing out individual youth and helping
the youth have a sense of achievement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
of the staff spoke about drawing campers into the activities at Camp, keeping
their eyes out especially for those who seemed quieter, more withdrawn, or
loners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Don: One of the
ways is to let them control telescopes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And when you see someone hanging back reluctant to do that, you just
bring them up front and say, you know come here, open the mirror covers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>[Or] you go and find out, you know, where
they are with right ascension, sidereal time, or something.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I try to give them opportunities, and if
theyre not taking them, you try to find out why.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Some of the counselors spoke of
particular instances where they purposefully sought out someone who was holding
back or seemed a little awkward within the group: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Mike: I try to get
them to, come out of their shells, and show them being a teenagers not so bad,
you dont have to be such a loner, things like that [Speaking of a particular
camper], I mean, opening up during the week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A lot of people were hanging out with him by the end of the week.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So I think that instilled confidence in him
and it helped the sense of community at Camp, people were interacting with him
more freely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
other way all staff spoke of developing confidence was by encouraging the
campers to succeed in doing their projects and develop a better understanding
of scientific concepts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They tried to
do this in ways that campers could take credit for their own achievements.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Paris: Now a lot
of groups that I worked with had extraordinarily ambitious plans that a group
of professional astronomers would be hard pressed to do, on our equipment, in a
week So hopefully in the end they actually did gain some confidence and did
understand and perceive that what they had done is unusual and very difficult,
and that they should have a lot of confidence and a lot of self-respect, not
only for what they did accomplish, but for the motivation that they have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ben: One of the
neatest things Ive learned from the [U of A] teaching program is  making them
present what they already know and making them take that next step say, all right,
what do you know about this, and they kinda spill their guts about it, and then
 youll give them small little definitions, well well define this as this
And they then, they are able to make the next steps like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Filling a Niche<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
asked each staff member how they felt they fit in with the larger picture of
Advanced Astronomy Camp, and each one shared about the special niche that they
thought they filled, ranging from having experience with particular equipment
and telescopes, being able to provide leadership or a fun atmosphere for the
campers, reaching out to the quieter young people, and providing a particular
knowledge base.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each of the counselors
asserted that Don was the backbone of Camp, providing the structure and inspiration.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most (three of the four) also shared that
they had learned many of their teaching skills from him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each staff member demonstrated awareness
that each of the counselors filled a different need at Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Paris expressed this consciousness in regard
to the diverse knowledge base of the staff: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Some of [the
counselors] are, their primary profession is professional research astronomers,
others are doing something else but they have an interest in astronomy all of
the others have a different, different skill set, too, and different subfields
of astronomy theyre interested in or other other areas like geology And so, I
think those are some really, thats really good cross-fertilization to have,
and Im glad we have these people from different backgrounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Beyond the general awareness
conveyed by the counselors, Don communicated another benefit of having such
diverse counselors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Id like [the
campers] to get to know the counselors pretty well, because, through them they
can see, um, what re- what real scientists are like, or people aspiring to be
scientists at different stages of their careers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>College, graduate school, post-doc, faculty, we model all of the
range of uh, academic experience, and all these people come from different
backgrounds, they have different hobbies, different likes and dislikes,  and I
think it would be good for the students to see that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Each
of the five staff also felt that being a scientist or having skills and
training as scientists, was very important for the roles they played at
Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When asked
whether they thought of themselves as primarily a scientist, a teacher, or
both, three answered scientist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Don and
Mike answered both and also described why their backgrounds and knowledge of
science were important to the nature of Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I must make it clear that the staff also highly valued teaching and
indeed most of them pointed to different things they had learned over the years
in regard to teaching.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact, one of
the staff was about to finish his teaching degree preferring teaching high
school to pursuing physics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However,
they also felt that their experience as scientists was important to the nature
of Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Paris described this general
feeling:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>One of the things
that I think makes Camp more  unique  is the fact that the, Don the Camp
Director and several of the staff members are professional scientists.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Theyre full time researchers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And that gives a perspective and a skill set
thats available to the campers that I dont think you could get
otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thats nothing, nothing at
all against professional educators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Its just that this is an opportunity, and you you really, its hard to
be both<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Full time you cant do
both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So thats one thing where Camp
has its, I think its a fundamental strong suit, is that the kids are, exposed
to and in fact live with for a week, professional research scientists who can,
and absorb their their mindset, their techniques, how they utilize all the
skills theyve learned over the years</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Don also spoke about the importance
of his career as a professional researcher: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Well Im both, I
dont think I could be a good teacher if I werent also a reasonably good
scientist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Students like research,
really, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You look at the
Advanced Camp and they were on the chat page and theyre talking about
cosmology, the accelerating universe, black holes, dark matter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So research excites them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And so I think its almost a responsibility
to uh, be as good a researcher as you can. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
final theme that emerged from interviews with the staff was general awareness
of what the campers took away from Camp including working with great equipment,
experiencing the beauty of the night-time sky, experiencing success in their
projects, and bonding with their peers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Ben shared in particular about the importance of peer relationships to
the youth:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>I think another
part is being around somebody like my own people.<span style="mso-spacerun:

most of these students, go back, you know to the high schools whatever, theyre
probably the only ones that really like astronomy, and dont have very many
people that speak a common language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And when they come to Astronomy Camp, everybody speaks the language, and
you know, theyre, they really feed off each other, you know what theyre
interested in, what theyre excited about, what they know, um. And its its
that community of what, you know, what theyre excited about is really,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In addition to the
themes emerging from all the staff interviews, Don had a unique perspective as
the Director of Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>His comments reflected encompassing knowledge and goals for campers,
counselors, and Camp in general in addition to how they all fit together in the
larger picture of Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just as the
staff reflected general knowledge of what the youth took away from Camp, so Don
demonstrated insight into what the counselors gained:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Id like for [the
counselors] to learn how to teach better, uh, to um, develop at least a talk or
an activity of their own and deliver it Although everyone had their own roles
to play, they didnt always have the talks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But I would like for this to be an opportunity for the counselors to
develop their own educational skills and confidence and make some of their own
decisions about what what appeals to them and what doesnt.<span

I want them to have fun too.</p>

the end, what makes Advanced Astronomy Camp such a successful and exciting time
for the youth who attend?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is
interesting to note how much the camper interviews intertwined with what the

successful youth organizations and the themes generated from Camp
interviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just as themes and
sub-themes emerged from analyzing the camper and staff interviews, so I have
found that several overarching ideas arise out of the study as a whole that
help make sense of why youth are so enthusiastic about Advanced Astronomy Camp:
youth-centered philosophy, science activity that feels meaningful, and a fun
and aesthetic environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In this
section of the study on Advanced Astronomy Camp I will discuss these themes, move
to implications of these ideas for other third arena programs and schools,
discuss ideas for further research, and end on a personal note with some of the
consequences of this research experience on my own life.</p>

Aesthetic Environment<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is difficult to downplay the importance of youth-centeredness in the success
of Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Seeing the
youth as capable, responsible, contributing scientists permeates every activity
and every staff interaction at Camp. Don made this philosophy clear to the
campers from the very beginning of Camp in his introduction:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>If you have a good
idea, something else youd like to do, something else youd like to explore,
something thats wrong with the schedule, something youd like to substitute,
whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Would you feel free to
propose that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We can generally find
ways to accomplish almost anything That would be the pinnacle for us, that we
have taught you well enough that you can operate the telescope and equipment to
do your own measurements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>In his statement Don sets the stage
for campers to change the activities at Camp, approach the staff with ideas
(not just questions), and manage the equipment: Advanced Astronomy Camp is for
the youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This youth-centered
philosophy suffuses the rules and expectations, the projects (or general
curricula), and the interactions with staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>That this had a positive effect on the campers is evident in their
comments about the privilege of operating the equipment themselves, designing
and completing their own projects, approaching the staff with ease, and
appreciating the sense of freedom on the mountain.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This
youth-centeredness is interwoven into the design of Camp, in the rules and
activities that shape and form the week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The main rule of let Don know where you are at any given time and the
explanation of why that is important intrinsically bestows responsibility on
the youth and has similarities to the basic but important rules that Heath
and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>McLaughlin (1994) found in
community youth organizations: minimal rules with maximum impact.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Beyond this youth are held to basic rules
that all astronomers who use the mountain must follow: using the equipment and
telescopes carefully, cleaning up the kitchen and dorm rooms, and treating the
common facility with care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The projects
that shape the whole Camp, taking up the entirety of every evening from 7pm to
sunrise and most of the afternoons as well are laden with choices for campers,
empowering them by basing Camp on their input and abilities, even if it means
making mistakes at the telescope or having insufficient time for analyses later
due to time-management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These are
temporal arcs of activity that allow youth to take on the roles of astronomers
in planning, taking data, and presenting their findings with real-life
constraints, principles that Heath and McLaughlin (1994), Heath (2001) and
Larson (2000) also found empowering for youth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Youth-centeredness
is also found throughout the staff interactions with campers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In their interviews staff articulated how
they waited to answer questions until they had ascertained what the youth knew
and then tried to find ways to help them make the next conceptual step in
understanding so that it was the youth who were making that step rather than
the staff giving it to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Likewise
they also sought to draw youth into the larger group and build confidence by
providing opportunities for youth to demonstrate their capabilities and
knowledge through operating telescopes and answering questions in front of the
group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the same time, while campers
had the staff at their disposal to answer questions, help analyze data, and
share their expertise, the campers were responsible to run the telescopes, take
the data, make crucial decisions concerning their projects (sometimes ones they
later regretted), and order their lives at Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>What seems to underlie both Camp and some community youth
organizations is the youth-centered belief in students capabilities and the
roles of teachers/leaders in assisting the students to discover their potential
and use it for projects of intrinsic worth such as research projects similar to
what astronomers currently do or artistic productions of worth to the
community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These strategies of building
confidence and setting youth up for real-life achievements are responses to
Larsons (2000) plea to understand how leaders can shape intrinsically
motivating experiences for adolescents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Hand-in-hand with
youth-centeredness is the role of meaningful science activities at Advanced
Astronomy Camp, at least activities that the youth appear to find
meaningful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each of the ten youth
expressed positive feelings about their sense of doing real science as
opposed to school science and spoke about their understanding of science in
ways that demonstrated a developing complexity of thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why do the youth feel that doing what they
describe as real science is so empowering?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There are several possible explanations.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>First, like the successful community youth organizations that
Heath and McLaughlin (1994) studied, youth are intensively involved in
collaborative work toward a project or performance bounded in time and
prepared for outside audiences or evaluators (p 472).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The projects are presented to an audience
who actively engages in scholarly research as students and professionals in the
fields of astronomy and related sciences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This may give the campers a sense of doing something meaningful to the
larger world beyond Camp, although they still are not professional
astronomers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Camp only lasts a week and
campers were not responsible for requesting grants for projects, applying for
time on the telescopes (although they did have to submit proposals for
telescope time within Advanced Astronomy Camp), or submitting journal
articles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Neither are they paid for
their work.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In addition, the
type of thought in which campers engaged includes much of what Chinn and
Malhotra (2002) identified as taking place in the minds of scientists: choosing
a research question, selecting multiple variables to investigate, facing
concerns with methodological errors, doing comparative research, making
indirect inferences, devising indirect procedures to address their questions,
and deciding between multiple theories for explanations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Campers expressed awareness of these issues
in their interviews and I also observed these in their daily work and final
presentations before their peers and the staff of real scientists.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As youth made their own decisions in
choosing, researching, and interpreting their projects, some began to
understand from a first person perspective (perhaps <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>because</i> of that first person perspective) how fallible the
judgments are of those who are famous for the dominant theories in astronomy,
history, or art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although Sarah
probably articulated this thought process the best, she was not alone in
developing a more complex understanding of science.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indea result of the common interest in astronomy that attracted youth to
Camp, the staff drawing individuals into the group in ways described above, and
the authentic activities that they pursued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Moreover, once relationships were established, youth learned from each
other through discussions that took place throughout Camp: confronted by the
different viewpoints, interpretations and experiences of their peers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is difficult to express how much the
youth valued the sense of community at Camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We should seek further opportunities to develop community around
activities and projects that youth find intrinsically meaningful, challenging,
and equipping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>All of this may
relate to Popkewitzs (1998, 2002) theory of a limiting alchemy that transforms
disciplines into school subjects that manage children in school.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Activities at Camp were more closely modeled
on what astronomers do and limited by what astronomers would have faced with
these facilities and time limits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
telescopes, technology, and scientists that facilitated this research were
important parts of what the youth found valuable and equipping.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Andrea diSessa (2000) points out the
important roles of tools within a scientific community, from telescopes to
computers and textbooks to ways of thinking: Tools are badges of membership,
symbols of commitment and accomplishment (p.39).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Mastering a tool or piece of technology can bring pride, a sense
of ownership, and feeling of belonging within a scientific community.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This may explain why youth spoke so highly
about using the equipment and technology at Camp and why they had so much pride
in their abilities to manage it better than some astronomers (Kevin).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Engaging youth in self-designed research
activities with the accompanying instruments can be one way of empowering and
naming students as important resources, decision-makers, and contributors to
the larger scientific community (or the artistic community for that
matter).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>One final element
of Advanced Astronomy Camp that should not be downplayed is the fun and
aesthetic environment, both physical and social.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>While not discussed enough in camper interviews to be named as a
theme, there was a great deal of fun that occurred at Camp: late night
conversations, silly songs at the 40-inch, breaking rocks open at a geology
lecture, a liquid nitrogen cannon, homemade liquid nitrogen ice-cream, an
outburst of pranks on the final night, and a humorous roast of the campers at
graduation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, the pool
table, gym, open computers, and movies all played parts in creating fun
opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These experiences
contributed to the informality between campers and staff and the sense of
community as a whole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also not to be
forgotten are the beauty of astronomical objects, the night-time sky on a
secluded mountain-top, and the natural surroundings that were often spoken of
in interviews with campers and staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The value campers placed on these is demonstrated by the pictures they
took and placed on the unofficial Advanced Astronomy Camp 2002 web-page:
beautiful pictures of the Lagoon and Eagle nebulas, photos of the mountain-top
at sunrise and sunset, the lay-out of telescopes at the National Observatory on
Kitt Peak, and various desert animals found on Mt. Lemmon.<a style='mso-footnote-id:

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Heath (2001) and Heath and Roach (1999) also
found that aesthetic elements may have contributed to the exceptionality of
youth organizations formed around the arts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Advanced Astronomy
Camp is a unique experience shaped and formed by the environment, the special
facilities, and the Director, none of which are fully duplicable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However youth-centeredness, meaningful
activity within a specific subject, and a fun and aesthetic environment are not
unique as influences on learning experiences for youth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many of the them are found both in my study,
in studies of community youth organizations presented in the literature review,
and in research about scientific inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This provides an opportunity to integrate them into other educational
endeavors inside and outside of school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
study of Advanced Astronomy Camp, located in the context of studies on informal
science education, community youth organizations, and science inquiry, brings
to the fore some opportunities for third arena organizations, particularly the
potential roles of university faculty in the education of youth, issues of
equity in who gets these opportunities, and the nature of science
projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Advanced
Astronomy Camp presents an example of how university faculty and community
professionals can be unique resources in educational opportunities for
youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of the staff found that
their expertise and roles as scientists were important to the opportunities
that they provided for the campers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They did not intend to be a substitute for school learning but rather a
complement because of their experience in scientific research.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This allowed them to involve and equip the
youth to do science projects comparable to those of current astronomers and to
answer questions about space projects, theoretical physics, geology, and
astronomy with greater knowledge than many of the other adults in campers
lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Camp provides a different model
than most of the science camps and programs portrayed in the literature review
as faculty do not simply come in for an hour lecture or as symbols of who can
be successful scientists but instead integrally involve themselves with
students doing their own projects over the course of a week.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This type of involvement need not be limited
to scientific research projects but could also involve the expertise and
related projects of faculty in other disciplines.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>University faculty and community professionals may be able to
help create educational projects that feel meaningful or authentic to youth
through their expert knowledge and experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They may also help connect youth to equipment and technology that give
access to different sorts of scientific, artistic, or literary processes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The short length of camps may supply opportunities
for professors, graduate students, and other professionals to be more intensely
within their time limitations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Or they
may provide the beginning of longer term relationships between schools and the
community, allowing youth and adults to build foundations of common interests
and common projects that can be continued throughout a school year.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Adults will probably even gain new ideas and
insights from the youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I am not
suggesting that professional educators be replaced by outside experts but
rather that the two have different strengths in what they can offer to youth
and should complement one another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Indeed, Advanced Astronomy Camp depends on schools to provide education
in subjects like math in preparation for what youth learn at Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In turn, several campers leave Camp
motivated to learn more math and science during the school year.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>School and out-of-school programs can and
should complement and support each other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In this research
about Advanced Astronomy Camp questions arise about issues of equity in
attending third-arena programs. In the United States there is a market for
camps and other educational opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looking at only one website, www.kidscamps.com, I found at least three
hundred science and environmental camps located across the country, some of
which have the resources to pay for marketing on that website.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What cultural capital do these opportunities
give youth and what kind of capital do they need to attend such programs in the
first place?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At Advanced Astronomy Camp
youth seem to leave more equipped and confident about their abilities, with
deeper understanding of the processes and complexity of science, an excellent
experience to mention on a resume for college (one camper mentioned that this
helped her in an interview at Harvard), and connections with university faculty
and graduate students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, not all
science camps provide these sorts of experiences and benefits.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Several of the youth discussed other camps
they had attended that they found boring and disillusioning, and while these
experiences may still look good on resumes, the campers did not find their
confidence or interest stimulated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Who gets the
opportunities to attend educational camps and are they as effective as they
could be?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is difficult to
evaluate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While many of the camps
around the country, at least those that can afford advertising on websites,
probably draw primarily on middle-class populations, all but one of the
articles on science programs that I mention in my literature review sought out
youth who were under-represented in science at institutions of higher
education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clearly there are
opportunities available for many youth, although I do not know whether certain
youth have access to better educational programs than others.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Are the youth participating in various
out-of-school learning environments having experiences where they feel like
they contribute to their community or an academic field?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Do they gain the relationships with people
in the academic or professional workplaces that may give them important
connections and visions for life later on?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Is there inequity or imbalance in the types of programs available to
different youth based on class, race, gender, abilities, etc.?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What kinds of benefits do science camps give
over arts-based community youth organizations?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another
question raised is whether such an experience is essential to be a future
scientist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The answer is complex.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although many youth are accepted into
university science programs without extracurricular science activities on their
resumes, such experiences may provide them training in scientific thinking and
give them useful connections at universities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>On the one hand, learning to think like a scientist is not usually
necessary until graduate school; even Paris shared that he initially struggled
in graduate school to adapt the mindset required to investigate his own
research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand, Advanced
Astronomy Camp may have the potential to give youth the motivation to push
through the logistics of making a career in science.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Although it was only eight days long, some youth attending
Astronomy Camp in years past have left inspired to take a second math or
physics course on top of what they already planned for the year.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At least one woman expressed to me that
though she knew high school and even college would be boring after her
experience at Camp, she would have the endurance to get through because she
knew what was at the end of the tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If an eight day experience can help provide this sort of vision to
youth, it seems like an excellent investment and something that would be
especially beneficial for youth who might not otherwise consider careers in
science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Camps cannot replace or repair
what happens day in and day out in school, but what they have to offer should
not be downplayed as a supplement or complement to those educational
programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
research also brings up issues as to the place and kind of scientific reasoning
in the school curriculum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These may be
difficult to include in a school curriculum due to the current push for
standards and often rigid curricula, yet opportunities to engage youth in
complex science inquiry of their own during the school year could have very
positive ramifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One implication
of trying to apply this might be whether science teachers have ever had
opportunities to conduct personal research projects themselves, whether outside
of school or in their own classrooms (like action research).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If most people never have opportunities to
design their own research questions and studies until graduate school, most
teachers probably do not have experience in conducting complex self-designed
research and it may be more difficult for them to create such opportunities for
their own students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>First,
I would like to know how campers view of Advanced Astronomy Camp and what they
find valuable it about changes over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A narrative study inquiring into how their stories change over time and
what place Camp has in them would be intriguing and could offer valuable
information about how a week-long experience can affect students lives.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A long-term study could also show whether
campers understanding of science is retained and/or continues to change,
whether Camp affects their school learning, and whether it continues to give
them perseverance to continue in science through college.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
broad study of people who have attended Advanced Astronomy Camp over the years
might shed light on the long term effects of participating in Camp are.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How many people attending Camp go on to
pursue science as a career? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>How do they
view themselves as contributing to education?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>How do women see the role of Advanced Astronomy Camp in their
educational careers as opposed to the men who attend?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>How many campers attend the University of Arizona as
undergraduate or graduate students in fields related to astronomy (i.e. how
does this program benefit the university in recruiting students)?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Studying Advanced
Astronomy Camp in sequential years might also reveal whether the themes rising
from camper and staff interviews stay the same for each Camp experience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do campers find their peer relationships
significant each summer?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do all
counselors share a youth-centered philosophy?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>How do the counselors change in their understanding of how they
contribute to Camp as they continue their involvement over the years?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In addition to
studies of Astronomy Camp, there is a need to add to the research literature on
informal science education in general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>How do other camps or informal programs engage youth in scientific
inquiry helps them develop more critical understandings of science?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do these programs have the same influences
on students?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do participants find
similar things valuable about their experiences?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It is often noted
with sadness that women do not pursue careers in science and math past high
school and especially college (particularly physical sciences), even if they
are doing very well in the subjects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Don has noted that the young women who attend Astronomy Camp tend to
keep in touch and talk about how important the experience was to them far more
than the young men do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why is
this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unfortunately my study did not
focus specifically on the issue of gender and only one of the campers mentioned
anything about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What she said though
was interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She found it very
empowering to be among other young women at this Advanced Astronomy Camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although I do not know the specific impact
certain elements have on the young women at Camp, I do know from his interview
that Don made special efforts to discuss historical contributions of women to
astronomy at Advanced Astronomy Camp and stated that he believes women are
every bit as capable as men in math and science.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is also apparent that counselors sought to draw youth out into
meaningful activities to build their confidence (both men and women) and that
the campers formed special relationships with their peers where they feel a
sense of commonality and not being alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These characteristics, also found to be important for girls education
by Hansen, Walker and Flom (1995), may have an impact on young womens
experiences at Advanced Astronomy Camp and suggest one area of further study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Participating
in Advanced Astronomy Camp was a wonderfully empowering experience for me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Foremost, it was an opportunity to closely
learn from and contribute to a long-standing educational investment of my
father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It also turned into a place
where I made many friends among the counselors and the campers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I attended a reunion of several campers from
the Midwest later in the summer and even saw one of the campers at a local high
school where I supervise pre-service teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>My interest in astronomy was piqued and I am beginning to engage in it
as a hobby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What perhaps most surprised
me is how inspired I felt to do my own research after seeing the youth engage
in their projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The excitement that
they felt pursuing open-ended questions, the frustrating circumstances they
conquered, and the successes they experienced as they presented what they found
and did not find all gave me courage and enthusiasm in taking up this research
project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have no doubts that this
influence on my own life from participating in Advanced Astronomy Camp will
continue for a long time to come and I look forward to seeing how my own understanding
of the experience changes over time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Parents/Guardians of Summer 2002 Advanced Astronomy
Campers,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Astronomy
camp is an exciting educational experience, as I well remember from attending
the first camp directed by Dr. Don<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>McCarthy, when I was thirteen years old.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The camps have grown a lot since then, as has my curiosity over
what makes them such an unusual and interesting experience for youth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, as a masters student in Curriculum and
Instruction, I am seeking to better understand what youth learn from Advanced
Astronomy Camp for my masters project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For this purpose I will be serving as a counselor this summer at the
camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, believing that the
campers themselves are the best evaluators of their experiences and what they
have learned, my primary source of research data will be interviews from about
one-third of the astronomy campers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For this
reason, I am seeking your permission to tape-record an interview (approximately
thirty to forty minutes in length) with your child at the end of (or closely
following) camp this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Participation is completely voluntary and you may withdraw your
permission at any time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interview
questions will be given to the campers ahead of time so that there are no
surprises, and they may choose not to answer any of the questions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I am also asking permission to copy some
student work (like notebooks) during camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I will be the only one with access to the interview recordings and will
give pseudonyms and change any identifiable characteristics of interviewees in
my thesis paper and any subsequent publications in order to respect
confidentiality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, I will be
sending a transcript of your childs interview later in the summer so that he
or she may check it for accuracy and understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thank you
for your help in studying what makes Astronomy Camp so special and unique.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Please fill out and send the attached
permission slip in the enclosed stamped envelope by June 7, 2002.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you have any questions, feel free to
email me at mccarthy_deborah@hotmail.com or call me at (520) 742-7584.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You may also direct questions about this
project to Maureen Bischof from the School of Education at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison at (608) 265-3229.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dear Counselors of Summer 2002 Advanced Astronomy Campers,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Astronomy
camp is an exciting educational experience, as I well remember from attending
the first camp directed by Dr. Don McCarthy, when I was thirteen years
old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The camps have grown a lot since
then, as has my curiosity over what makes them such an unusual and interesting
experience for youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, as a
masters student in Curriculum and Instruction, I am seeking to better
understand what youth learn from Advanced Astronomy Camp for my masters
project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For this purpose I will be
serving as a counselor this summer at the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In addition, believing that the campers themselves are the best
evaluators of their experiences and what they have learned, my primary source
of research data will be interviews from about one-third of the astronomy
campers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>I will also be interviewing the counselors and the director of the
camp to better understand how they contribute to the campers experiences, and
for this reason, I am seeking your permission to tape-record an interview
(approximately thirty to forty minutes in length) with you at the end of (or
closely following) camp this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Participation is completely voluntary and you may withdraw your
permission at any time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interview
questions will be given ahead of time so that there are no surprises, and you
may choose not to answer any of the questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I will be the only one with access to the interview recordings and will
give pseudonyms and change any identifiable characteristics of interviewees in
my thesis paper and any subsequent publications in order to respect
confidentiality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, I will be
sending a transcript of your interview later in the summer so that you may
check it for accuracy and understanding.</p>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>ADVANCED ASTRONOMY CAMP<br>
Required Essay</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>NOTE:</u></b><u> </u>The essay requirement for the
2002 Advanced Camp has changed from previous years. Please follow these
directions carefully. <b><br>
</b><br>
Admission to the Advanced Astronomy Camp requires an essay of at least 700
words. This essay is our primary means of gauging a student's motivation,
creativity, maturity, and ability to follow directions. These are qualities we
value highly in our Advanced Camp students. Each essay must combine both fact
and imagination and should have an imaginative title. The factual basis must
cite at least two published references not including Internet sites. We include
some sample references to help you incorporate current understanding. </p>

<p>To help prospective campers gauge the level of competition, we provide two
essays from students who attended the 2000 Advanced Camp: <a
href="http://ethel.as.arizona.edu/astro_camp/johnston.htm"><span
style='color:windowtext'>&quot;The Slumber of the Suns&quot;</span></a> (Cheryl
Johnston) and <a href="http://ethel.as.arizona.edu/astro_camp/rapoport.htm"><span
style='color:windowtext'>&quot;The Legacy of Copernicus&quot;</span></a> (Ezra
Rapoport). </p>

<p>New students must write on one of the following three topics. Previous
Advanced Campers wishing to reapply must write about a proposed research
project that might also interest other Advanced Campers. See below for a more
detailed description.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u>ESSAY TOPICS</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<b><u>Essay #1:</u></b> Over 80 planets have been discovered orbiting other
stars. You are responsible for choosing one of THESE planets or its
hypothetical moon(s) to colonize. Where would you go and what would you hope to
learn there? </p>

<p><b><u>Essay #2:</u></b> You visit a hypothetical planet in a KNOWN binary
star system of your choice. Describe how and why life on your planet would be
different from that on Earth. </p>

<p><b><u>Essay #3:</u></b> You are the assistant of a famous astronomer (past
or present). Describe a research project in which you are involved and how it
has impacted your life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u>STUDENTS
WISHING TO REPEAT THE ADVANCED CAMP </u></b></p>

<p>We encourage previous advanced campers to reapply for the Advanced Camp in
year 2002. Since so many qualified students are expected to apply for the first
time, it is likely that no more than six repeating campers can be admitted.
Last summer, two repeating students were selected. Each year's Advanced Camp
has a different theme for daily activities, but the main focus at night will
still be the research projects conducted by teams of students using the
equipment in our collection. </p>

<p>Students wishing to reapply must write an observing proposal, similar to,
but more detailed than, the proposals they wrote during a previous Advanced
Camp. Based on your experience with our telescopes and instruments, you should
be able to describe a new project which you and other students could conduct
together during the one week camp. To be successful, you do not have to solve
any modern mysteries of the Universe, just propose something which interests
you, utilizes our equipment, and would interest other students. Your project
may be a challenging one but it must be realistic. You must include the
following in your proposal: </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>1. Title </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>2. Abstract </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'>A concise paragraph summarizing
your goals.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>3. Scientific Description </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'>Why is this project interesting and
what do you hope to learn from the observations?</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>4. Scientific Method </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'>How will you obtain and analyze
your data? What telescopes and instruments do you require? How much observing
time is necessary?</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>5. Team Management </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'>As the leader of your project, how
will you involve other students in the observing, analysis, and presentation
aspects of this project? How will you deal with the fact that these students
may not understand anything about your topic but are eager to learn and
participate? How will you interact with your colleagues to encourage, teach,
and manage them during the weeklong camp? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Attempted to discover new asteroids and comets by comparing
CCD images of the sky along the ecliptic and away from the Milky Way and the
Moon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12-inch CCD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Observed a satellite and cosmic rays and may have evidence
for some variable objects, but did not find any new asteroids or comets.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>Tried to resolve globular clusters in other galaxies and
compare them to those of our own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>61-inch CCD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seeing was very difficult each time the group attempted to

<p class=MsoNormal>Attempted to analyze three star-forming nebulae including
the Eagle, Trifid, and DC604 through the spectrometer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>60-inch spectrometer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This very ambitious project was complicated by a closed
