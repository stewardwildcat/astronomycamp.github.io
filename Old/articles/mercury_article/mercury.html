``I can't believe they gave us so little telescope time!  What kind of
priorities are they using?''  ``We've got time on the 60-inch tonight
for the dwarf Cepheid project.  When is your team scheduled?''  It is
easy to imagine hearing lines like these in the halls and offices of
many observatories and astronomy departments, but not from high school
students.  However, these students were involved in the Advanced
Astronomy Camp held at one of the University of Arizona's
observatories this past summer. Here, for a full week, they were
completely immersed in doing science and engineering with modern
astronomical equipment under the guidance of professional astronomers
and qualified graduate and undergraduate students.

<P>

The Advanced Astronomy Camp models the full scientific process: The
participants formulate questions, devise observing plans, assess the
feasibility of their projects, submit plans for critical review,
conduct observations, analyze data, and present findings to their
peers. In the process, they experience the thrills of discovery, the
sometimes capricious nature of research and scientific equipment, and
the usefulness of coursework in mathematics and science.

<P>

Nine women and twenty men from nine different states enrolled in the
1993 Advanced Camp.  They ranged in age from 14 (high school freshmen)
through 18 (college sophomore) years. All had completed the basic
entrance requirements: a letter of recommendation from a science or
math teacher, a creative 500 word essay on a topic in astronomy or
space science, and satisfactory completion of algebra II or
geometry. Seven students had previously attended the Beginning
Astronomy Camp (there is also an adult camp).

<P>

Astronomy Campers observe with all of the University of Arizona
Observatory's telescopes in the Catalina mountains north of Tucson,
including exclusive use of a 30-inch and a 60-inch telescope on Mt.
Lemmon, as well as a 16-inch Schmidt telescope and one night on a
fully computer-controlled 61-inch on Mt. Bigelow.  Campers also enjoy
access to a CCD detector, photometers, darkroom and an extensive
library.  A SUN workstation, along with IBM and MAC computers are
available for image processing, planning nighttime observations,
calculating the visible passes of orbiting satellites, accessing
CD-ROM images, etc.

<P>

<H3>
Research Proposals
</H3>

Prior to arrival in Tucson, this year's campers received a letter
encouraging them to contemplate observing goals and potential
projects. Many arrived with personal observing agendas for the week,
some modest, some formal, some hopelessly grandiose. During the first
two days, the staff provided some additional suggestions and
encouraged the entire group to exchange ideas, help each other, and
forge collaborations. The students embraced this process with
enthusiasm and engaged in often-animated brainstorming. The vehicle
for organizing and disciplining their thoughts was an observing
proposal, a simplified version of the proposals professional
astronomers must write to conduct their research.  Groups of
collaborating campers were asked to write a brief scientific
justification of their proposed work and a defense of their choice of
telescope and instrument.

<P>

They produced an impressive array of creative, insightful, often
practical, and occasionally humorous proposals. Ideas ranged from
exploring the technical capabilities of equipment to comparing
observations with model predictions.  For example, one group proposed
to conduct time-series photometry of a variety of short-period
variable stars.  They then wanted to use the same photometer in a dark
room to measure the light curves of illuminated styrofoam balls, which
would be shifted relative to each other to simulate the theoretical
orbital motions of the binaries.  One ambitious camper suggested the
very thoughtful but unachievable task of analyzing the spectrum of the
black hole candidate Cygnus X1 to search for abnormal abundances of
elements other than hydrogen, which might indicate the presence of
nucleosynthesis in an accretion disk surrounding the black hole.

<P>

The telescopes did not sit idle while the students developed and honed 
their ideas.  The staff and campers devoted the first full night to
``engineering,'' the testing of telescope and instrument combinations
to determine instrument noise, how faint an object could be positioned
in the instrument apertures, fields of view, and telescope tracking.
In the process the campers learned the mechanics of operating the
instruments and pointing the telescopes. The students used the
engineering results to assess the workability of their ideas and to
justify telescope size and exposure time. In the course of these
efforts they dealt directly with some of the basic aspects of
instrumentation, including read noise, dark currents, flat fielding,
and plate scales.

<P>

The proposals were due on the second full day of Camp. The Camp
director and counselors served as the Telescope Allocation Committee,
evaluating proposals and awarding telescope time. Fourteen of the
twenty proposed projects received telescope time, and every camper
participated in at least one scheduled project.

<P>

Virtually all of the projects proved to be more difficult and complex
than the investigators initially imagined, and they learned valuable
lessons about tackling real-world problems.  Some found that they
needed to employ more mathematics than expected to interpret the
results.  Others found the systematic and random uncertainties
inherent in empirical data frustrating.

<P>

One ambitious group undertook a quasar survey with the Schmidt
telescope, titled ``Short-term photographic survey of quasi-stellar
objects.''  The concept was deceptively simple, merely to take
long-exposure photographs through blue and red filters of a
high-galactic-latitude field, then scan the 5 X 6.25-inch (6.0 X 7.5
degree) films by eye for point-like objects which were bluer than the
majority of stars in the field.  Tracking problems and a miscalibrated
setting circle cost some observing time, which substantially reduced
the exposure times of the films.

<P>

Nevertheless, the group excitedly set out to scan the films and
discover quasars, until they realized how many thousands of stars the
photographs contained.  They devised a simple blink-like search method
which quickly produced a very blue object not on published star
charts.  Their elation soared with the realization that they had
discovered an ``exotic variable blue object.''  However, this marvel
soon disappeared from the photograph, a tenacious dust particle which
finally gave way.  The disappointment was deep but short-lived, and
they focused on the enjoyment and challenge of the process.

<P>

A project titled ``Solar observing with a CCD'' combined astronomy and
engineering.  The investigators proposed to image sunspots with the
CCD mounted to a Celestron 8-inch telescope.  In consultation with the
Camp director, these students decided the CCD would not be destroyed
if an aluminized mylar solar filter were attached over the telescope
aperture and the CCD exposed through a narrowband filter.  Because the
largest mylar filter available was 3.5 inches in diameter, a special
mounting (cardboard and duct tape) had to be devised.
 
<P>

A spectrograph and CCD combination was used extensively for
``Spectroscopy of nebulae in the summer sky'' and ``Spectra of a dwarf
Cepheid.''  The investigator for the first project recorded emission
lines in M8 (Lagoon nebula) and M57 (Ring nebula) and successfully
identified hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen on the basis of their
wavelengths relative to comparison spectral lines.  The campers who
conducted the latter project interpreted their data to indicate that
the temperature and luminosity of CY Aquarii, an RR Lyrae-class
pulsating star that varies in brightness over a period of 88 minutes,
had changed significantly over a time span of 20 minutes.

<P>

The other observing programs included both imaging and photometry.
For example, the CCD was employed to image the M87 jet, and Pluto was
detected and its orbit monitored for the duration of the Camp.
``Photometry of galaxies in the Virgo Cluster'' indicated that spiral
galaxies have bluer color indices than ellipticals.  Another group
recorded light curves for several eclipsing binaries.

<P>

In all of their observations, campers quickly came to appreciate the
importance and ubiquity of computers and detector technology in modern
astronomy and, by extension, in virtually all scientific and
engineering disciplines.  They glimpsed the large amount of work and
attention to detail required to conduct careful scientific research.

<P>

The week of observational efforts culminated in a ``conference'' on
the last full day of the Camp. Each research team presented its ideas,
methods, and findings to the entire group, which had assembled in the
gymnasium atop Mt.  Lemmon.  They made free use of some of the common
tools of professional presenters, such as overhead projectors and
computer displays.  At the end of each talk the speakers fielded
often-pointed questions from other campers and staff members.

Parallel Activities
</H3>

While Advanced Camp primarily emphasized hands-on research,
complementary activities were scheduled throughout the week.  The main
academic activities consisted of lectures and demonstrations by the
staff and invited speakers covering a wide range of subjects.  The
staff began with discussions of the basic properties of light and
telescopes, including laboratory demonstrations of the CCD,
photometer, and spectrograph. The campers saw an extensive liquid
nitrogen demonstration and heard about galaxies, archaeoastronomy, and
cosmology.  Some talks were designed to be very challenging, including
a little calculus, to give those who were considering a technical
career a taste of what awaits them.

<P>

The guest speakers presented a fascinating array of talks, from tales
of personal discoveries to a review of a current hot topic in
astronomy.  Jim Christy and his wife Charlene described Jim's
discovery, naming, and announcement of Pluto's moon Charon.  In the
61-inch dome at sunset, David Levy recounted the story of his recent
discovery of ``The Comet of the Century'' (Shoemaker-Levy 9; for more
on the comet see page 15).  He described the predicted impact of SL9
with Jupiter and related how the comet was discovered with
light-corrupted photographic plates on a partly cloudy night.
Following his talk, all campers viewed SL9 and Jupiter through the
61-inch telescope.  Fulvio Melia, a University of Arizona theoretical
astrophysicist, reviewed the intensely-studied but still-mysterious
gamma-ray bursters and propounded the view that, whatever their
nature, they are cosmological in origin.

<P>

Time away from the fratiguing work schedule was provided for rest and
recreation, which included hikes in the beautiful alpine surroundings
of the observatory, billiards, often-spirited volleyball matches, and
whatever else the campers concocted during the free time scheduled
every day.  At mid-week, after a short night's observing, the entire
group journeyed down through Tucson to Kitt Peak National Observatory.
Astronomers from Steward Observatory, the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory, and the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory conducted in-depth
tours of the 25-meter and 12-meter radio telescopes, the largest (3.8
meters) optical telescope on the mountain, a solar telescope, and the
Spacewatch telescope which searches the skies for asteriods whose
orbits bring them close to Earth.  After a pizza dinner back in
Tucson, the group visited the Mirror Laboratory and viewed the
newly-cast 6.5-meter mirror.  The final stop before returning to
Mt. Lemmon for a night of observing was at a convenience store.
Imagine 40 hungry and sugar-starved campers and counselors loose in a
Circle K.

<H3>
Astronomy as a Career
</H3>

On the final full day of Camp, the staff conducted an informal seminar
concerning the realities of a career in scientific research,
particularly astronomy.  The primary aim of the Advanced Camp is not
to shunt students towards careers in astronomy or other sciences or
engineering.  In fact, under some considerations, the most important
participants are those who will not enter technical careers, given the
lack of knowledge of science and the scientific method among the
general public.  Nevertheless, many of the students express a very
strong desire to pursue a career in astronomy, and at least ten of the
16 former campers now enrolled at the University of Arizona have
chosen physics/astronomy majors.
   
<P>

The staff did not discourage careers in astronomy but rather tried to
give a balanced and unconstrained view of the potential joys,
opportunities, fierce competition, and disappointments which might lie
ahead. The seminar covered the entire educational and career ladder in
detail with current and frank information, since the staff is composed
of undergraduates who are former Camp participants, graduate students,
and faculty.  The campers heard about the college workload, varied
quality of instruction, and the 20:1 or greater oversubscription rates
for the best graduate programs.  They were exhorted to learn to read,
write, and speak well, regardless of their future disciplines.  Many
people do not realize the critical importance of communication in
technical fields and its role in career advancement. For those intent
on careers in astronomy, the staff stressed the importance of a very
solid undergraduate preparation in math and physics, high Graduate
Record Exam scores, and warned of the pressures of graduate school and
the very difficult job market at all levels.

<P>

<H3>
Graduation Day
</H3>

The final day of Camp featured a unique graduation ceremony. Each
individual student was ``roasted'' for something funny s(he) did
during the week. The awards included ``development of the Schmidt
list,'' ``best rendition of Irish folk song at 5 AM,'' ``best hat,''
``kamikaze volleyball serve,'' ``immaculate grammar,'' etc.  Special
recognition went to the young theorists who developed ``The Belgian
Waffle Universe'' which began in the ``Big Batter'' and has since
evolved four forces (thick, thin, textured, and smooth) along with six
known elementary particles called the ``elementary strawberries''
(ripe, unripe, fresh, decaying, seeded, and seedless).  Each camper
received a certificate, and individuals who accomplished exemplary
research or wrote especially meritorious creative essays for the
entrance requirement received some special awards donated by the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific and <CITE> Astronomy </CITE>
magazine.

<P>

<H3>
Operating Philosophy
</H3>


Astronomy Camp operates on a minimal budget in order to provide a
rewarding educational experience at the lowest possible cost and to do
so with truly dedicated personnel who are enthusiastic about their
science and about sharing it with lay men and women.  A tuition cost
of $485 for the full week provides the primary funding (this figure
has not changed in the last five years).  Each year graduates of the
Adult Camps, the NASA Space Grant Consortium, and the Planetary
Science Institute fund about 10 scholarships, which can aid students
attending either Beginning or Advanced Camp.

<P>
 
Although outside funding probably is available, the Camp has not
sought it for operating expenses in order to demonstrate what
dedicated individuals can accomplish on their own.  Additionally, some
funding agencies require so many evaluations, followups,
justifications, visitations, etc. that much of the fun of educating is
lost.  They also have difficulty evaluating the intangible influences
that an experience such as Astronomy Camp can provide, such as the
motivational and emotional impact that a single counselor has as a
role model or that results from the inspiring experience of
controlling a large telescope.

<P>

<TT>

Astronomy Camp is sponsored by The University of Arizona Alumni
Association under the guidance of Lisa Roubal and former camper Teresa
Longazo. The Camp Director, Donald W. McCarthy, is an Associate
Astronomer at Steward Observatory.  Eric Hooper, a graduate student at
the University of Arizona, was a counselor at last summer's Astronomy
Camp.  The Camp is grateful for support received for capital equipment
and materials from NASA, Kodak, numerous local vendors, and
astronomers from the Tucson-area observatories and laboratories.
Requests for information can be directed to the Alumni Association at
1-800-BEAT-ASU and (520)621-9026.

How I Spent My Summer Vacation
</H2>
<H3>
<A HREF="BFox.html">Becky Fox</A>, Phoenix, AZ - Advanced Camp Participant
</H3> 
 
<P>

My interest in astronomy began when I was four and spent evenings
counting stars with my father in the back yard, dreaming of someday
finding out what was ``up there.''  This dream became an obsession,
and when my parents offered me the chance to go to Astronomy Camp, I
enthusiastically said, ``YES!''  When Don asked me to write about my
experience, though, I found myself at quite a loss - how do you cram
the experience of a lifetime into a few hundred words?
 
<P>

I will always remember the crazy stunts we pulled and the friends I
made at camp, but I think the memory I will treasure most is the
excitement of doing real science. Today, most teachers sternly remind
teenagers, ``Don't touch it, you'll break it,'' so Astronomy Camp,
where we are encouraged to use (but not break) anything available, is
nothing short of incredible.
 
<P>

Where else would I get an opportunity to conduct a spectroscopy
project I dreamed up, much less use a 60-inch telescope to do it?
During the week I spent on Mt. Lemmon, I took spectra from the Lagoon
and Ring nebulae, recorded them with a CCD, and processed the data to
discover the composition of the nebulae.  Going was tough sometimes
(especially 3 AM sessions with logarithms and the evening I spent
with IRAF image processing software), but the sheer joy of discovery
made it all worthwhile.  (I never expected to be jumping for joy when
He I and H beta showed up in my spectra, but I was!)
 
<P>

The week I spent at Astronomy Camp opened a whole universe for me, and
cemented my determination to become a professional astronomer.  After
experiencing firsthand the thrill of astronomy, I can't see myself
doing anything else.  That little girl who was counting stars has
grown up -- and thanks to Astronomy Camp, her dream is finally coming
true.
