The next Advanced Teen Astronomy Camp is scheduled for<br/>              
<strong>June 19-26, 2019</strong></span>            <br/>            <br/>            
<strong>The Advanced Teen Astronomy Camp</strong> is quantitative in its approach. Students are required to have completed satisfactorily either Algebra II or Geometry in school. Attendance at the Beginning Astronomy Camp is not necessary and does not automatically qualify a student for the Advanced Camp.            <br/>            <br/>            
Students should be between the ages of 14 and 18 years. Some exceptions are made in special circumstances by <strong><a href="mailto:dmccarthy@as.arizona.edu">Dr. McCarthy</a></strong>, the Camp Director.            <br/>            <br/>            

<a href="../images/atc_picnic.jpg"><img src="../images/atc_picnic_sm.jpg" width="300" height="200" style="margin: 0px 10px 4px 4px" align="right" border="0" /></a>            
<strong>Beginning in January 2019, qualified applicants will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis until the Camp is full</strong>. 
Admission is limited to 25 students. To be successful applications must follow all the stated directions. 
Applications will be judged <strong>competitively</strong> based on the quality of their essays, ability to follow directions, and teacher recommendations. 
Prospective students <strong>must contact the Camp Director</strong> before applying.            <br/>            <br/>            

Entrance into the Advanced Teen Camp is increasingly competitive. In 2018, the Camp was filled by mid-January and only 30% of all applications could be accommodated. 
We strongly urge students to adhere to the specific entrance requirements, to follow directions exactly, and to do the best job possible on the essay. Although we want former students to reapply, preference will be given to new students. 
<strong>Former Advanced Campers</strong> wishing to reapply must write about a research project which could be accomplished using Camp equipment and which could also involve other Campers. 
See the <strong><a href="camp_spec/ATC/essay.html">essay topics</a></strong> for more information.                        <br/>            <br/>  	  </div>

Before Applying</span>, you must consider your child's transportation to and from Astronomy Camp. We require that students arrive in 
Tucson on the first day (June 19) of Camp <strong>before</strong> 3 pm Tucson time. On the last day (June 26), we will be driving two 
hours from a remote mountain site to Tucson, so students <strong>cannot</strong> depart on airline flights any earlier than 2:00 pm 
Tucson time. Limitations in airline schedules may make these arrangements difficult depending on your location. Although we can 
accommodate a few students arriving one day early and/or departing one day late, such arrangements are inconvenient and will necessitate 
additional cost to you.             <br/>            <br/>            

Please email <strong><a href="mailto:dmccarthy@as.arizona.edu">Dr. McCarthy</a></strong>, if you have travel concerns and questions.                        <br/>            <br/>            

Also, please note the following:            
<ul>              
<li>The tuition fee of $1250 includes all expenses during the Camp session such as room, board, materials, and local travel.</li>             
<li>Travel arrangements must be confirmed with Dr. McCarthy no later than <strong>April 15</strong>.</li>
