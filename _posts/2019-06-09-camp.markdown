## Astronomy Camp - Join us for some far-out science!

### What is Astronomy Camp?

Under the dark skies of Southern Arizona, students of all ages explore with large telescopes and experience the excitement of scientific inquiry. **Astronomy camp is all about discovering the Eureka moment!** The <a href="http://www.azwild.org/regions/skyisland.php">&quot;sky island&quot;</a> environment of  <a href="./pages/lemmon.html">Mount Lemmon Station Observatory</a> immediately north of <a href="http://www.visittucson.org/visitor/about/">Tucson, Arizona,</a> is inspirational to all and motivates exploration through wonder. Since its inception in 1988, Astronomy Camp has hosted thousands of people <a href="./images/US&World2014.jpg">worldwide</a>. Each camper becomes a real astronomer on top of the mountain, operating research-class telescopes and technology, interacting with leading scientists, interpreting their own observations, investigating their own questions and curiosities, and most importantly having fun.

Astronomy Camp provides unique opportunities to explore the skies and the environment in general.  Each Camp is an **&quot;immersive learning experience&quot;** combining all four STEM letters: Science, technology, engineering, and numerical thinking. Not to be left out, we push for practice of clear communication strategies and reserach-based teaching techniques. We emphasize **hands-on learning** with activities driven by student involvement and interest. A prior background in astronomy is not required, neither is a connection with <a href="http://www.arizona.edu">The University of Arizona</a>. 

### Who are we?

Astronomy Camp is described in numerous <a href="./publications.html">publications</a>, including <a href="./publications.html#Camper_Articles">personal accounts</a> written by Astronomy Campers. These science camps are available to both teenagers and adult from all over the world. We seek to motivate all students to further their interest in science, math, engineering, and technical fields, not necessarily to become scientists. Need-based scholarship opportunities are available to encourage all interested students to explore science and broaden their minds.

We are proud that <a href="GraduateStudents.html">former Campers</a> earned advanced degrees in a wide variety of disciplines and that <a href="./past_campers.html">many others</a>, including <a href="./CampCounselors.html">our staff</a>, have become leaders in their respective fields. 

### Parents
Parents often ask why Astronomy Camps are life-changing for both them and their children. <a href="publications.html#Contributions">Educational research</a> reveals several reasons:

* <span style="color: white">Real scientists as mentors.</span>
* <span style="color: white">A personal approach, treating youth as colleagues rather than children.</span>
* <span style="color: white">*Authentic* scientific inquiry with realistic projects involving modern equipment.</span>
* <span style="color: white">Student peers with common interests in science and engineering.</span>
* <span style="color: white">A fun attitude toward learning, exploring ideas, and searching for answers.</span>
* <span style="color: white">The aesthetic qualities of the <a href="http://www.azwild.org/regions/skyisland.php">&quot;sky islands&quot;</a> of Southern Arizona with dark skies.</span>
