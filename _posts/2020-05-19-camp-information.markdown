**Astronomy Camp**is directed by astronomer [Dr. Don McCarthy]({% post_url 2020-05-17-director %}) together with an engaging, [knowledgable staff]({% post_url 2019-06-09-alumni-CampCounselors %}), many of whom are former Astronomy Campers. Building on more than 30 years of experience, they offer an opportunity for both young and old to experience the universe in new and exciting ways. Teenage students gain a *cosmic perspective* of the Earth, themselves, and where they belong in the Universe. We examine careers and reinforce school lessons through authentic scientific investigations and engineering applications. With the wide range of topics incorporated into the Astronomy Camp curriculum, it is a well-rounded science camp; much more than star gazing. Adults escape from the regular routines of daily life freeing them to wonder and seek answers to a lifetime of questions. Every Camper is able to **Reach for the Stars!**

As the evening falls, campers begin to observe a plethora of celestial objects under the [dark skies](http://darksky.org) of Southern Arizona; they become astronomers. Campers operate research-class telescopes, keep nighttime hours, interact with leading scientists, interpret their own observations, and investigate their own questions about Astronomy and the Universe. Campers will have access to telescope such as those on Mount Lemmon. Examples of which include:

* 11-inch Celestron with [Hyperstar](https://starizona.com/hyperstar/)
* 12-inch Meade LX-200
* [61-inch Kuiper](http://james.as.arizona.edu/~psmith/61inch/) telescope on Mount Bigelow
* [24, and 32-inch](http://www.as.arizona.edu/schulman-telescope) telescopes on Mount Lemmon
* [90-inch Bok](http://james.as.arizona.edu/~psmith/90inch/90inch.html) telescope on Kitt Peak
* [Arizona Radio Observatory](http://aro.as.arizona.edu/) 12-meter telescope on Kitt Peak
* [Submillimeter Radio Telescope](http://aro.as.arizona.edu/smt_docs/smt_telescope_specs.htm) at the [Mount Graham International Observatory](http://mgio.arizona.edu/)

By the end of Camp all Campers are intimately connected with some of the most advanced technology available for cosmic discovery. Astronomy is about exploring the unknown, and Astronomy Camp fosters that philosophy.

**Campers** have an amazing array of unique tools to help them explore their universe. All telescopes can be equipped with a <a href="facilities.html">selection of instruments</a>, including 35mm cameras, digital cameras, a photometer, three CCD cameras, two CCD spectrometers, and specialized equipment for detailing imaging of the Sun. The Advanced Camps feature access to professional instruments for imaging at visual, infrared, and radio wavelengths with large format CCDs and HAWAII (1024x1024 pixel) electronic cameras. A complement of <a href="pages/computing.html">computers</a> allows campers to analyze data using professional languages (IRAF, IDL, and others) and to simulate astronomical phenomena.

**During** the daytime, internationally known <a href="pages/faculty.html"> scientists</a> speak on current scientific topics, including the latest NASA space missions. Students also engage in engineering-related projects (e.g., eTextiles, crystal radios, dissecting cameras), explore the diverse geology and ecology though hiking, outdoor demonstrations, and travel between mountaintop observatories. The Camps also incorporate <a href="http://www.novaspace.com/">Space art</a> and musical interpretations of scientific processes. All Camps include an in-depth tour of The University of Arizona's <a href="https://mirrorlab.arizona.edu/">Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory</a>, now producing not only the world's largest telescope mirrors with 8.4-meter diameters but also some of the most advanced large-format optical designs for telescopes to date. <br />
